INTEREST RATES HURT <Location gate:gateId="1467" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1425;1440;1443">U.S.</Location> MAY HOUSING SALES
  Sales of new single-family homes
  tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher
  mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
      &quot;There should be another month or two of very weak new home
  sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
  should become more stable by mid-summer,&quot; said economist

      The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
  616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the <Organization gate:gateId="1472" orgType="government" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Commerce
  Department</Organization> said.
      Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
  about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
  according to <Person gate:gateId="1473" firstName="Stephen" rule="PersonFull" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Roach" kind="fullName">Stephen Roach</Person>, economist at <Organization gate:gateId="1474" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Morgan Stanley</Organization>.
      The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
  of the market, he and others said.
      &quot;The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
  unexpected by homebuyers,&quot; said <Person gate:gateId="1475" firstName="Cynthia" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" surname="Latta" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1438;1460">Cynthia Latta</Person>, an economist
  with Data Resources. &quot;They were so startled, they wanted to
  hold back and see what would happen.&quot;
      The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
  sharper than expected, some economists said. &quot;We fully expected
  a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,&quot; said

  Institutions.
      Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
  existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
  homes.
      <Person gate:gateId="1469" rule="Unknown" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="female" gate:matches="1438;1460" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Latta</Person> of Data Resources said strong sales of new
  condominiums in the Northeast and on the <Location gate:gateId="1462" locType="pre" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">West Coast</Location> were
  reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
      Christian of the <Location gate:gateId="1463" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1425;1440;1443">U.S.</Location> League of Savings Institutions said,
  &quot;Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
  is going to stabilize and give us a good second half.&quot;
      Others were less optimistic, however.
      &quot;We clearly won&apos;t have a boom (in new home sales) but I
  don&apos;t think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
  housing,&quot; said <Person gate:gateId="1468" rule="SaysPerson" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="male" gate:matches="1429;1459">Chimerine</Person> of <Location gate:gateId="1464" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Wharton</Location>.

  <Organization gate:gateId="1466" orgType="unknown" rule="BaseofOrg" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Bank of New York</Organization>, said, &quot;The lower sales level will be
  maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
  There won&apos;t be much specific improvement in coming months.&quot;
