Jürgen Klopp’s side have yet to win a <Organization gate:gateId="1426" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Premier</Organization> League match in 2017 and their run of two points from a possible 12 has seen them slip outside the top four for the first time since 24 September. The draw at home to league leaders <Location gate:gateId="1393" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1345;1352;1361;1367;1372">Chelsea</Location> was expected to be the turning point to halt their slide but the team followed that up with defeat at struggling <Location gate:gateId="1394" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Hull City</Location>. <Location gate:gateId="1395" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1339;1347;1360;1362;1368;1373;1376">Liverpool</Location>’s only league defeats this season have come against <Location gate:gateId="1396" locType="city" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Burnley</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1397" locType="city" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Bournemouth</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1398" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Swansea City</Location> and <Location gate:gateId="1399" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Hull</Location> – all teams currently in the bottom nine. None of the Reds’ top-four rivals have a similar record with <Location gate:gateId="1400" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1345;1352;1361;1367;1372">Chelsea</Location> losing only to <Location gate:gateId="1401" locType="city" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Arsenal</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1402" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1354;1371">Tottenham</Location> and Klopp’s side. <Person gate:gateId="1403" firstName="Antonio" rule="PersonFull" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Conte" kind="fullName">Antonio Conte</Person>’s side have dropped just two points in 12 matches against the bottom 10 – grinding out 1-0 wins at <Location gate:gateId="1404" locType="city" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Middlesbrough</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1405" locType="city" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Crystal Palace</Location> and <Location gate:gateId="1406" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Sunderland</Location> – and <Person gate:gateId="1423" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="1340;1391;1392" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Lallana</Person> believes <Location gate:gateId="1407" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1339;1347;1360;1362;1368;1373;1376">Liverpool</Location> need to discover something similar. “You can see [<Location gate:gateId="1408" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1345;1352;1361;1367;1372">Chelsea</Location>] have a lot of experience and that they are used to winning,” said <Person gate:gateId="1422" rule="SaysPerson" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="male" gate:matches="1340;1391;1392">Lallana</Person> in the <Location gate:gateId="1409" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1339;1347;1360;1362;1368;1373;1376">Liverpool</Location> <Person gate:gateId="1410" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="Echo" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" kind="firstName">Echo</Person>. “They know how to win games even when not at their best. You don’t have to always win by scoring five or six. Maybe that’s an area we need to improve on. We maybe need to realise how good we are at times. “Milly [<Person gate:gateId="1411" firstName="James" rule="PersonFull" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Milner" kind="fullName">James Milner</Person>] is probably the only one in our group who has that type of experience because it only comes from winning silverware like he did at <Location gate:gateId="1412" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Manchester City</Location>. Myself and the other players haven’t won titles or loads of cups so we need to learn from him and listen to him because that type of experience is vital. We need to learn and get back to winning ways in the league as soon as possible.” Being top of the table in November seems a long time ago now and the focus has shifted back to the pre-season aim of qualifying for the Champions League. <Location gate:gateId="1413" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1345;1352;1361;1367;1372">Chelsea</Location> are a distant 13 points ahead but the former <Location gate:gateId="1414" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1339;1347;1360;1362;1368;1373;1376">Liverpool</Location> winger <Person gate:gateId="1415" firstName="John" rule="PersonLocAmbig" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Barnes" kind="fullName">John Barnes</Person> believes the race for the top four will go right down to the wire with <Location gate:gateId="1416" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Everton</Location>, currently seventh, only 10 points from second-placed <Location gate:gateId="1417" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1354;1371">Tottenham</Location>. “I don’t think <Location gate:gateId="1418" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1345;1352;1361;1367;1372">Chelsea</Location> are out of sight but <Location gate:gateId="1419" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1339;1347;1360;1362;1368;1373;1376">Liverpool</Location> need to improve – the title race starts in March,” <Location gate:gateId="1420" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Barnes</Location> told the Evening Standard. “<Location gate:gateId="1421" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1339;1347;1360;1362;1368;1373;1376">Liverpool</Location> can still finish in the top four if everyone gets behind Jürgen Klopp, who is a very good coach.”
