JANUARY HOUSING SALES DROP, <Organization gate:gateId="402" orgType="unknown" rule="OrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">REALTY GROUP</Organization> SAYS
  Sales of previously owned homes
  dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual
  rate of 3.47 mln units, the <Organization gate:gateId="403" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">National Association of Realtors</Organization>
  (<Organization gate:gateId="406" rule ="OrgBracketOrg" gate:matches="399;400" orgType ="unknown">NAR</Organization>) said.
      But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the
  highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set in
  November 1978, the group said.
      &quot;The drop in January is not surprising considering that a
  significant portion of December&apos;s near-record pace was made up
  of sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatment
  under the old tax <Person gate:gateId="404" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="laws" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" kind="firstName">laws</Person>,&quot; said the <Organization gate:gateId="401" rule ="AcronymOrg" gate:matches="399;400" orgType ="unknown">NAR</Organization>&apos;s <Person gate:gateId="405" firstName="John" rule="PersonFull" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Tuccillo" kind="fullName">John Tuccillo</Person>.
