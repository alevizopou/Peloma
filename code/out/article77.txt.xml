DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED
  Roughly half of this year&apos;s expected
  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in <Location gate:gateId="781" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="761;769" kind="locName">the
  Netherlands</Location>, told <Organization gate:gateId="782" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Reuters</Organization>.
      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
  added.
      &quot;It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start,&quot; he said.
      Last year, <Location gate:gateId="780" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="761;769">the Netherlands</Location> planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country&apos;s combined &quot;A&quot;
  and &quot;B&quot; quota of 872,000 tonnes.
      This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota &quot;C&quot; sugar produced.
      Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
  allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.
