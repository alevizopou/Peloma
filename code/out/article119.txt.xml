  <Location gate:gateId="456" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="436;437">Brazil</Location>&apos;s coffee exports could amount to
  19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate
  of 35.2 mln bags, an <Organization gate:gateId="454" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="449;450;451" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">IBC</Organization> spokesman said.
      He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln
  bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in
  October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.
      He said the average limit of errors for the official crop
  harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first
  estimates officially published today.
      He said the <Organization gate:gateId="452" rule ="AcronymOrg" gate:matches="449;450;451" orgType ="unknown">IBC</Organization> agreed with a request by producers for the
  Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the
  guarantee minimum price.
