      The <Organization gate:gateId="415" orgType="unknown" rule="OrgXEnding" ruleFinal="OrgCountryFinal" gate:matches="394;412">Haitian American Sugar Company</Organization> closed on Friday because
  of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said <Location gate:gateId="417" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="393;396">Haiti</Location> has been
  flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the
  <Location gate:gateId="418" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Dominican Republic</Location> and refined <Location gate:gateId="419" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">U.S.</Location> Sugar from <Location gate:gateId="420" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Miami</Location>.
      The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000
  small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The
  protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the
  closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.
