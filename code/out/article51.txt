Usain Bolt insists he is fit and ready to race ahead of his first 200 metres of the season at the Muller Anniversary Games on Friday night. The six-time Olympic champion faces a key test of his fitness when he races for the first time since pulling out of the Jamaican trials with a hamstring strain. "I'm good, I'm feeling good, been training good now, I'm happy with where I am," the 29-year-old told a packed press conference. "My hamstring is good, I have no issue right now. I know I'm in good shape." Bolt's outing at the Olympic Stadium, the scene of his three Olympic gold medal wins at London 2012 in the 100m, 200m and sprint relay, will be his last before the Rio Games, where he will bid for an unprecedented 'triple triple' of Olympic crowns. "I'll definitely be there, I'm excited to go," the Jamaican said of his Rio hopes. "This is where history is going to be made, I'm excited to put on a show for the entire world to see. "This is my final Olympics, it's a big one." Bolt is familiar at dealing with, and defying, doubters, especially last year when he went into the World Championships in Beijing trailing two-time convicted drug cheat Justin Gatlin in the 100m and 200m world rankings only to leave China with the complete set of gold medals. "I'm definitely a tough competitor," he said. "Last year Gatlin was just not ready, it was the first time he was being chased. "It was hard for him, but this year is not going to be the same, I am in much better shape, so I won't leave it to the last second." Bolt insisted he was never worried his hamstring problem would rule him out of Rio. "When I got to the doctor he said if I had competed (in the trials) I would probably would have torn my hamstring really badly," he said. "I made the right decision. My coach always makes sure I put my health first. But I was never really worried because my coach always figures out a way to adjust the programme. "I was in pretty good shape before I had to pull out, so I wasn't really worried." It is now seven years since Bolt clocked his 100m and 200m world records of 9.58 and 19.19 seconds respectively and, with his intention to retire after the 2017 World Championships in London, the chances of him breaking them appear slim. Bolt, though, says he is focused on lowering his time in the 200m, an event he has always described as his favourite. "I'm happy that I didn't get a really bad setback this season, it was up and down, but I could always train," he added. "I think the competition, the energy, the work they have to put in to win the 100m in Rio will help my 200m and that's really my focus, trying to break the 200m world record."
