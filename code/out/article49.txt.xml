More than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports were involved in state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015, it has been revealed. The claims were made in the eagerly anticipated second part of the <Person gate:gateId="1148" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="1101;1135;1136;1137;1138;1139" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">McLaren</Person> Report which was published on Friday morning. <Person gate:gateId="1142" firstName="Richard" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="McLaren" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1101;1135;1136;1137;1138;1139">Richard McLaren</Person>, who coordinated the investigation into allegations of state-sponsored dopings in <Location gate:gateId="1143" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" kind="locName">Russia</Location>, concluded that an &quot;institutional conspiracy&quot; had been at work within the country. Speaking after the findings had been made public, <Person gate:gateId="1144" rule="PersonSays" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="male" gate:matches="1101;1135;1136;1137;1138;1139">McLaren</Person> said: “We are now able to confirm the findings of the first report: a cover up that dates back to at least 2011 and continued after the <Location gate:gateId="1146" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1104;1111;1122">Sochi</Location> <Person gate:gateId="1147" firstName="Winter" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Olympics" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1105;1121">Winter Olympics</Person> games. A cover up that has evolved ... and operated on an unprecedented scale.” “This process [of state-sponsored doping] evolved and was refined at <Location gate:gateId="1150" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1106;1116">London</Location> 2012, the summer University Games at 2013, the <Location gate:gateId="1152" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1109;1118;1119">Moscow</Location> IAAF World Championships in 2013 and of course <Location gate:gateId="1153" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1104;1111;1122">Sochi</Location> 2014.” He added: &quot;We do have evidence backing up what we said.&quot; <Person gate:gateId="1149" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="1101;1135;1136;1137;1138;1139" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">McLaren</Person> told reporters his final report provides more detail of just how large the doping conspiracy was, while supplying hard, physical evidence that cannot be contradicted. And in a clear message to those who criticised his interim report, most notably the <Organization gate:gateId="1154" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXKey" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">International Olympic Committee</Organization>, <Person gate:gateId="1145" rule="PersonSays" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="male" gate:matches="1101;1135;1136;1137;1138;1139">McLaren</Person> said he was dismayed by the &quot;in-fighting&quot; that marked the build-up to <Person gate:gateId="1155" firstName="Rio" rule="PersonFull" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Games" kind="fullName">Rio Games</Person> and has simmered ever since. &quot;I find it difficult to understand why we&apos;re not on the same team. We have shone a light on a dark secret,&quot; he said. <Location gate:gateId="1156" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Reading</Location> the report, it is difficult to disagree with him. The detail is staggering, even if it is still what <Person gate:gateId="1151" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="1101;1135;1136;1137;1138;1139" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">McLaren</Person> described as &quot;an incomplete picture&quot; given the huge amount of evidence his team has not been able to access. His team has found evidence that 78 Russian athletes at <Location gate:gateId="1157" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1106;1116">London</Location> 2012, including 15 medallists, had positive tests hidden by the <Location gate:gateId="1158" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1109;1118;1119">Moscow</Location> laboratory. Five of these medallists have not been sanctioned yet. It is a similar story for the World Athletics Championships in <Location gate:gateId="1159" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1109;1118;1119" kind="locName">Moscow</Location>, where four athletes had their positive samples swapped for clean ones. And at the 2014 <Person gate:gateId="1140" firstName="Winter" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Olympics" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1105;1121">Winter Olympics</Person> in <Location gate:gateId="1141" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="1104;1111;1122" kind="locName">Sochi</Location>, 12 medal-winning athletes are among those implicated.
