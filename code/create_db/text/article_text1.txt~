Sitting in a small, computer-lined room trying to remember a succession of different-coloured words scrolling past on a screen doesn't sound like the cutting edge of scientific research. However, academics at the University of East London are using word tests to assess the impact synaesthesia can have on memory – and the potential it might have to ward off the decline in cognitive function that can affect the elderly. Synaesthesia, the neurological condition that causes a blending of the senses – colours can be connected to letters and numbers, smells and tastes to music or touch to vision – has long been linked to creativity: famous synaesthetes include Sibelius and more recently Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga.But among the wider population it has remained a mysterious condition, although it is known to affect at least 4.4% of adults across its many forms.For instance, a grapheme-colour synaesthete might "see" the days of the week, letters and numbers as particular colours; a lexical-gustatory synaesthete will experience a particular taste in their mouth when they hear a given word; and an odour-visual/spatial synaesthete will see shapes, movement and colours when they detect certain smells.While scientists have known about synaesthesia for 200 years, only recently have researchers – across the fields of psychology, neuroscience and psycholinguistics – been able to focus their attentions on what effect the condition has on synaesthetes' broader cognitive function and, crucially, what synaesthesia may be able to do for the non-synaesthete population."There's definitely been a shift in the time I've been a synaesthesia researcher," says Dr Julia Simner, co-editor of The Oxford Handbook of Synesthesia, who runs the synaesthesia and sensory integration laboratory at the University of Edinburgh.Her team has recently been awarded a €1.3m grant by the European Research Council to develop the first test to identify the condition in children. And, in parallel, Simner and her team are working with researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen in the Netherlands on a study to try to identify the genes implicated in synaesthesia, which often runs in families"Before when I gave talks about synaesthesia, 96% of the audience would not believe it and the others – the synaesthetes – would think it was just obvious. Now it's shifted away from the burden of proof and we are free to explore the questions scientists really want to ask," Simner says, noting that advances in brain imaging had provided better evidence of the existence of synaesthesia."One of the streams of the latest research is to look at how synaesthesia affects development in a child. How much of your cognitive profile, what you're good at and what you're not good at, is affected by synaesthesia? We are looking for benefits and deficits as well as whether we can use multisensory effects to help learning in the average child," she says.Dr Michael Banissy, senior lecturer in psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, agrees that understanding how the condition develops in children will be a focus of future research and key to a broader comprehension of synaesthesia. "The focus previously has been on the synaesthetic experience alone but now there is interest in asking if more is going on beyond the synaesthesia."Dr Nicolas Rothen, who is carrying out research into synaesthesia and memory at the University of Sussex, agrees attitudes towards synaesthesia have changed. "Ten to 15 years ago, researchers were mostly concerned with showing that synaesthesia was real and not just metaphorical thinking. Now it is basically accepted that synaesthetes perceive the world differently and we are asking how it relates to other cognitive functions," he says.That may lead to interesting findings about cognitive function that can be applied to the general population. "People are different," says Rothen, "and we need to consider those individual differences. Synaesthesia is a neat way to study differences in perception and their relation to higher cognitive functions such as memory and language processing."But while scientists are interested in the differences between the brains of synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, research is also being carried out into how the two can be brought closer together."One thing we have found is that synaesthetes are not a different class of people – they simply have more explicit experiences," Simner says. "It's a more extreme manifestation of what all of us experience. Asking non-synaesthetes, 'What colour is A?' is a baffling question, but synaesthetes have a window into perception we all share; when pressed for an answer, we all pair more common letters with brighter colours or higher pitched notes with lighter colours." Studies such as one carried out by Dr Clare Jonas at the University of East London aim to take that link between synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes one step further, by training non-synaesthetes to have the same associations that synaesthetes have – and then assessing the impact their newly acquired synaesthesia has on their memory and cognitive function. That's where the word test comes in. After training a small group of young adults to associate certain letters with certain colours, the researchers use the test to find out if they remember words more easily if they are coloured to match their synaesthetic training.So far, the results seem to suggest that they do. The researchers assessed participants' memory before and after the synaesthesia training, by getting them to look at a list of words in which there was an odd one out – either a word written in the colour they had been taught to associate with it or a word whose meaning did not fit in with the rest of the list. "Using predictions based on what real synaesthetes do, there seemed to be a tendency towards the trained synaesthetes starting to behave like synaesthetes – having a better memory for things involved in their synaesthesia; if confirmed, that would be a good sign," Jonas says.Synaesthetes tend to remember the stand-out word more easily if it is in the correct colour, while they perform worse on tests in which words stand out because of their meaning – a list containing the words colander, whisk, spatula and ballet, for example.Researchers find that interesting in itself because going beyond the surface to the meaning of the word is normally the key to improving performance in these kinds of memory games. Although the research is at an early stage, Jonas believes training synaesthesia could have implications for helping older people ward off the decline in cognitive function that accompanies the early stages of Alzheimer's or even for helping patients recover from brain injuries. "One possibility," says Jonas, "is guarding against cognitive decline in older people – using synaesthesia in the creation of mnemonics to remember things such as shopping lists. As long as there is sufficient cognitive ability people could perhaps start doing the training in their 50s as a way of topping up their memory skills."One obstacle for the moment is the dull and time-consuming memorising of letters and their matching colours that the training demands. But researchers in the Netherlands may have found a way round that, developing a browser plug-in that automatically colours certain letters as part of a wider study into whether synaesthesia could be learned. Rothen, who has been carrying out studies involving training non-synaesthetes to behave like synaesthetes, also thinks synaesthesia research could have implications for the elderly, a potentially important breakthrough for an ageing population. "People are only just beginning to study synaesthesia over the lifespan. There is a theory that it may be protective in the case of age-related cognitive decline. There is evidence that grapheme-colour synaesthesia in particular leads to enhanced memory functions and we wondered if non-synaesthetes could be trained to have the same associations as synaesthetes and if it would lead to the same enhancements."However, while the studies demonstrate that it is possible to train non-synaesthetes to make the automatic link experienced synaesthetes – that C is yellow, for example – it is not yet clear whether the phenomenological experience, or the way synaesthetes will "see" either in their mind's eye or projected on to the page that C is yellow, can be induced. "We know that synaesthesia comes with benefits and that certain aspects can be trained. What we don't know is which aspect of the synaesthesia leads to the advantage – the automatic association or the phenomenological experience," Rothen says. But he adds: "We have some hints that synaesthesia leads to performance enhancements with regards to memory performance and visual mental imagery." Banissy's particular area of focus is social neuroscience and he explains that research into mirror-touch synaesthesia, in which, for example, just seeing someone else's face being touched sparks the sensation in the synaesthete that their own face is being touched, could reveal interesting findings about what causes synaesthetic reactions, as well as possible ways to harness those for non-synaesthetes. "Using brain imaging, we have shown that mirror-touch synaesthetes recruit similar parts of the brain as we all do when we observe others being touched," says Banissy. "However, mirror-touch synaesthetes hyper-activate this system to the extent that they literally experience what they see. In this regard, mirror-touch synaesthesia is interesting because it provides a unique window into how we represent other people's experience." Banissy is interested in the way synaesthesia develops in the brain and in particular how so-called hyper-excitability in areas of the brain such as the somatosensory cortex could cause synaesthesia. "In synaesthetes, the balance between excitability and inhibition is unusual. So the question is, can we generate synaesthesia in non-synaesthetes by manipulating that balance?"Scientists know that balance can be tipped by hypnosis or drugs: LSD, for example, produces a synaesthesia-like experience but more research is needed into other ways to change it."Using brain imaging, we can identify which areas are related to synaesthesia, but we can't tell what is causal. To do this, we need to modulate the relevant part of the brain and see what effect this has on generating synaesthetic experiences," Banissy says. While the researchers are coming from different scientific backgrounds and investigating the condition from different angles, a common thread is exploring how synaesthetic techniques can be applied more broadly."Synaesthesia is obviously useful to synaesthetes in some ways," says Jonas. "It would be really nice if we could find a way to give the useful bits of synaesthesia to people who don't have it.***********************************************************************Children born to fathers over the age of 45 are at greater risk of developing psychiatric problems and more likely to struggle at school, according to the findings of a large-scale study. The research found that children with older fathers were more often diagnosed with disorders such as autism, psychosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They also reported more drug abuse and suicide attempts, researchers said. The children's difficulties seemed to affect school performance, leading to worse grades at the age of 15 and fewer years in education overall. "We were shocked when we saw the comparisons," said Brian D'Onofrio, the first author of the study at Indiana University in the US. But he added that it was impossible to be sure that older age was to blame for the problems. Scientists have reported links between fathers' age and children's cognitive performance and health before but this study suggests the risks may be more serious than previously thought. The increased risks might be caused by genetic mutations that build up in sperm as men age. Researchers at Indiana University and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm studied medical and educational records of more than 2.6 million babies born to 1.4 million men. The group amounted to nearly 90% of births in Sweden from 1973 and 2001. Using the records, the scientists added up diagnoses for psychiatric disorders and educational achievements and compared the figures for children born to fathers of different ages. The numbers told a complex story. When health and school performance were compared across all the children, and factors such as parents' education and any history of psychiatric illness were taken into account, paternal age made little difference, except for cases of bipolar disorder, which rose with older fathers. But the researchers went on to do another analysis. This compared the health and performance of siblings in the same families, in the hope of ruling out differences between families that may have skewed the results. This time they found a striking link between paternal age and children's mental health and educational outcomes. According to the study, the children of fathers aged 45 and over were 3.5 times as likely to have autism, had more than twice the risk of psychotic disorders, suicidal behaviour and drug abuse, and had a 13-fold greater risk of ADHD. Fewer than 1% of children born to fathers younger than 45 had bipolar disorder, a figure that rose to about 14% in their siblings when fathers were 45 or older. In many cases, the risk of each disorder rose steadily with the father's age. The impact on academic achievements was less dramatic. Children with older fathers had a 60% greater risk of poor performance at age 15, defined as the equivalent of an overall fail grade across 16 academic subjects. They were also 70% more likely to spend less than 10 years in formal education. The findings appear in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.Some experts have questioned the analysis, because important factors that could be to blame were not ruled out.While looking at siblings has the advantage of ruling out differences from one family to the next – such as the number of books on shelves and diet – teasing out cause and effect is impossible.For example, a first born child may do better than his or her siblings at school, but that could be down to the parents having more time to spend with him or her than later children. The father being younger at his or her birth may be immaterial. Equally, a man's second wife may be a worse parent than his first wife, with knock-on effects for his children with her. Again, his older age would not be the direct culprit. In many countries, the age of first-time fathers is on the rise, and if the latest findings are right, that could drive more psychiatric and educational problems in future generations. The average age of men who became fathers in England and Wales rose from 30.8 to 32.6 years old in the two decades to 2011, with mothers' age rising to 29.7 years old over the same period. In 2011, 31,643 babies were born to fathers aged 45 and over. Some 833 fathers were 60 and over, according to the Office of National Statistics. Ryan Edwards, who studies the economics of health and ageing at the City University of New York, said the study revealed "some evidence that paternal age may worsen children's psychiatric, behavioral and educational outcomes." But he warned that the results hinged on the scientists' comparisons between siblings. "In that setting, it is difficult to separate the overlapping effects of paternal age, children's age, and birth order in a convincing way," he said. Jennifer Roff, also at the City University of New York, had similar reservations. "I'm not saying that there is no possible genetic role for paternal age. I simply think that this could be confounded with other environmental factors like birth order. The extent of the problem will vary. I can imagine that for things like cognitive scores, this could be a larger problem than for things like schizophrenia."***********************************************************************One of our most mysterious and intriguing states of consciousness is the dream. We lose consciousness when we enter the deep waters of sleep, only to regain it as we emerge into a series of uncanny private realities. These air pockets of inner experience have been difficult for psychologists to study scientifically and, as a result, researchers have mostly resorted to measuring brain activity as the sleeper lies passive. But interest has recently returned to a technique that allows real-time communication from within the dream world. The rabbit hole between these worlds of consciousness turns out to be the lucid dream, where people become aware that they are dreaming and can influence what happens within their self-generated world. Studies suggest that the majority of people have had a lucid dream at some point in their life but that the experience is not common. As a result, there is now a minor industry in technologies and training techniques that claim to increase your chance of having a lucid dream although a recent scientific review estimated that the effect of any particular strategy is moderate at best. Some people, however, can reliably induce lucid dreams and it's these people who are allowing us to conduct experiments inside dreams. When trying to study an experience or behaviour, cognitive scientists usually combine subjective reports, what people describe about their experience, with behavioural experiments, to see what effect a particular state has on how people reason, act or remember. But both are difficult in dreamers, because they can't tell you much until they wake up and active participation in experiments is difficult when you are separated from the world by a blanket of sleep-induced paralysis. This paralysis is caused by neurons in the brainstem that block signals from the action-generating areas in the brain to the spinal nerves and muscles. The shutdown happens when Rapid Eye Movement or REM sleep starts, meaning that dreaming of even the most energetic actions results in no more than a slight twitch. One of the few actions that are not paralysed, however, is eye movement. This is where REM sleep gets its name from and this window of free action provides the lucid dreamer a way of signalling to the outside world. Using a procedure first verified by sleep researcher Stephen LaBerge, the sleeper can signal to researchers when they have begun their lucid dream by using pre-arranged eye movements. The person moves their eyes in the agreed way in the dream, which occur as genuine eye movements, which are recorded and verified by electrodes that are placed around the eye sockets. This simple but ingenious technique has allowed a series of experiments on the properties of the dream world and how they are reflected in brain function. These neuroscientific studies have been important for overcoming an initial objection to the concept of lucid dreaming: that lucid dreamers were awake but just relaxed, or perhaps even fraudulent, claiming to be experiencing a dream world when they were not. Studies led by neuropsychologists Ursula Voss and Martin Dresler have shown that the brain activity during lucid dreaming bears the core features of REM sleep but is distinct from both non-lucid dreaming and the awake state, suggesting that it is not just a case of wishful thinking on the part of either the participants or the researchers. Some of the most interesting studies involve in-dream experiments, where participants are asked to complete pre-arranged actions in their lucid dreams while using eye movements to signal the beginning and end of their behavioural sequences. A recent study by neuroscientist Daniel Erlacher and his colleagues at the University of Bern compared how long it took to complete different tasks while lucid dreaming and while awake. These included counting, walking a specified number of steps, and a simple gymnastics-like routine. They found that the "mental action" of counting happened at the same speed regardless of whether volunteers were dreaming or awake, but the "physical actions" took longer in dreams than in real life. The research team suggested that this might be due to not having the normal sensory feedback from the body to help the brain work out the most efficient way of coordinating itself. There is also an amateur community of lucid dream enthusiasts keen to explore this unique form of virtual reality. This stretches from the fringes of the New Age movement who want to use lucid dreams to access other planes of existence (best of luck with that), to a more technologically oriented community of dream hackers who sample scientific research to try to find reliable methods for triggering lucidity. The connection with established studies can be a little haphazard and methods veer between the verified and the barely tested. In some online discussion boards, there have been reports of people using medications intended for Alzheimer's sufferers, which have the side-effect of causing vivid dreams, based on little more than hearsay and data reported in a patent application. Some researchers have highlighted the potential of lucid dreaming to advance the science of consciousness but it's a difficult area to study. The currents of consciousness run unpredictably through the tides of sleep and the science of dreaming is still very much in the age of exploration. It's also a conceptual problem that some feel unequipped to tackle. After all, what can we make of consciousness when it creates a new world and our experience of it?***********************************************************************Taller men and women are more likely to develop cancer than their shorter peers, according to a major study that sheds new light on the link between height and the disease. Researchers in Sweden found the risk of women developing cancer of any kind rose by 18% for every extra 10cm of height, while for men the risk rose by 11% – although height is not as great a risk for cancer as smoking, obesity and a poor diet. Dr Emelie Benyi of the Karolinska Institute, who led the research, said there were several possible reasons for the link. “One is that taller people have a larger number of cells in their body which could potentially transform to cancer. It could also be that taller individuals have a higher energy intake which has previously been linked to cancer.” The study analysed data on 5.5 million people born between 1938 and 1991, with heights ranging from 100cm (3ft 3in) to 225cm (7ft 6in). Assessing the impact of height on developing different forms of cancer, they found the increased risk was highest in skin cancer, rising 30% for every 10cm in height. They observed a 20% increase in the risk of taller women getting breast cancer. The Swedish researchers did not look at possible confounding factors such as smoking in their study, but the size of the sample and the good quality data meant that it could be taken seriously even though the full results have not been published, other scientists said. The early results of the study, conducted by scientists from the Karolinska Institute and University of Stockholm, were presented at the annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology conference in Barcelona and will be published in full in due course. “This observation has been made before in previous studies, and we already knew that breast and prostate cancers can be associated with height,” said Prof Mel Greaves of the Institute of Cancer Research. One biologically plausible reason was to do with growth hormone, Greaves said. An earlier study showed that people with genetic dwarfism had very little cancer. “People with genetic dwarfism have a mutation in their growth hormone receptor and we know that growth hormone and growth hormone receptor are critical to tumour growth too,” he said. Experiments in mice genetically engineered to make excess or very little growth hormone had also shown that their cancer rates increase or decrease. “We know that in humans growth hormone not only stimulates bone growth during our growing years, but stimulates cell growth in general and blocks cell death. So the level of growth hormone someone has could affect cancer risk by pushing up cell numbers,” he said. Prof Jack Cuzick, director of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, said: “The association between height and cancer has been known for some time; many cancers are increased in incidence in tall people. This study should add important further confirmation in a population-based setting. “The mechanisms for this effect are not clear and are worth further study. They may relate to the fact that the growth hormones related to height also are in some way stimulating cancer cells, but details are lacking.” Dr Jane Green, clinical epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, said: “In general, I would caution against interpreting a link as causal – however for height and cancer there is considerable evidence that suggests that the link is not explained by other known factors. Clearly, adult height is not itself a ‘cause’ of cancer, but is thought to be a marker for other factors related to childhood growth. “To put risk associated with a non-modifiable factor like height in context, it is worth noting that taller people have lower risks for heart disease and a lower risk of death overall.” A breast cancer charity urged taller women not to worry that they may get the disease. “Though these findings suggest a possible link between being tall and having an increased risk of breast cancer, just because a woman is tall, doesn’t mean they will definitely develop breast cancer,” said Carolyn Rogers, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care. “We must stress that the biggest risk factors for developing breast cancer are being female, getting older and for some, a significant family history of the disease.”***********************************************************************Researchers have created the most detailed simulation of the history of the universe, complete with exploding gas clouds, swirling galaxies, ravenous black holes and countless stars – born to die in violent supernovae that blast the chemical elements for planets and life out into the cosmos. Described as one of the most complex computer models ever created, the simulation was crunched on supercomputers that took six months to complete calculations that would have taken an average desktop computer 2,000 years to process. The simulation draws on the laws of physics and theories for the formation of galaxies and stellar evolution to recreate a large part of the universe from 12m years after the big bang until today, nearly 14bn years later. It will help scientists test how well their theories of the universe work, by comparing the appearance of the virtual cosmos with observations made using telescopes and other instruments. "We have this problem in astrophysics that we can't go and do experiments in the lab to test our theories," said Mark Vogelsberger at MIT, who worked on the simulation. "The only way to test them is to compare our models with the best observations out there." The computer model simulates the behaviour of dark matter, the invisible material that coalesced in the early universe to form a cosmic web, and dark energy, the mysterious force that drives the expansion of the cosmos. As the universe evolves, the first galaxies form with fledgling suns and supermassive black holes at their centres. Huge expanses of tenuous gas fill the spaces between the galaxies. At first, the only elements are hydrogen and helium. Heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen, are forged inside stars, before being ejected into space when the stars explode. The simulation models what happens in a volume of space 350m light years across. One light year – the distance light travels in one year – is roughly 10 million million kilometres. The simulation is the first to show both large-scale structures such as the distribution of gas, and small-scale features such as the number and chemical signatures of stars in each galaxy. The scientists checked their simulation against images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and found remarkable agreement. But discrepancies between observations and the simulation show where scientists need to rethink their explanations of how the universe evolved. Vogelsberger said they have already found disagreements between the simulation and the real universe that need exploring. Their model gets the proportions of galaxies right, but the stars in low mass galaxies – those about 100 times less massive than the Milky Way – are older than they should be. "That means the simulation is forming those low-mass galaxies too early, so the stars are too old compared to the ones in the real universe," Vogelsberger said. Michael Boylan-Kolchin, an astrophysicist at the University of Maryland, said: "I'm impressed at their audacity and that they were able to make it work. This will help us with a number of open questions. What were the first galaxies in the universe like? Where are their remnants today? The better the simulations, the better we can answer these questions." Vogelsberger said that the smallest features the simulation showed were around 1,000 light years across. In 10 years, that might improve to show features a few light years across. To get beyond that, and recreate the individual planets and stars, becomes much harder because the calculations are so large. One of the major hurdles facing the researchers now is how to share the simulation so that others can study it. "If people want to work on it, we have to copy it over to their institutions, and that takes a few months even if you have a fast internet connection," said Vogelsberger.***********************************************************************The first UK study to give ketamine to severely depressed patients has found that it had dramatic positive effects on some long-standing sufferers who had not responded to other treatments. The government announced in February that ketamine would be upgraded to a Class B banned substance in the face of evidence that it has caused physical and psychological harm to recreational users. But researchers at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Oxford observed that 29% of patients in a study, some of whom had suffered from depression for more than 20 years, experienced significant improvement in mood four to seven days after their final dose of the drug, with four of the 28 subjects them completely free from depression at that point. Dr Rupert McShane, a consultant psychiatrist at Oxford Health and researcher in Oxford University's department of psychiatry, warned against self-medication, emphasising that patients in the trial were carefully monitored. He said: "This really is dramatic for some people and it's the sort of thing that really makes it worth doing psychiatry … we've seen remarkable changes in people who've had severe depression for many years that no other treatment has touched. "It's very moving to witness. Patients often comment that the flow of their thinking seems suddenly freer." About one in 10 people in the UK suffer from some form of depression in their life and McShane estimates that 180,000 people suffer from moderate or severe depression that has not responded to other treatment. The Oxford study, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology on Thursday, involved 28 patients with treatment-resistant depression being given either three or six intravenous infusions of 0.5mg/kg of ketamine, each lasting 40 minutes, at Warneford hospital's ECT clinic in Oxford. Four to seven days after the final infusion, eight of them had responded to the treatment, measured by their depression "score" falling by 50% or more, of whom four were in remission. Among those who responded to ketamine, the duration of benefit varied widely, from 25 days to eight months, with the median 2.3 months. Ketamine is seen by the researchers as a substitute for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is sometimes used for people with treatment-resistant depression but carries risk of memory loss. One of the reasons the drug is thought to work is that it has a direct impact on the subgenual anterior cingulate, the part of the brain where overactivity is seen in people with depression. It works rapidly compared with some antidepressants, which can take 10 or more days to take effect. One of the reasons ketamine was upgraded to Class B was because it has been associated with major bladder problems, but these were not experienced by the patients in the trial. They were given about half the amount of a typical recreational dose, although heavy users of the drug, popular among clubbers, take several grammes a day. Some patients experienced distorted perceptions and/or felt disconnected from their body but only during infusion. They did not feel euphoric nor suffer loss of memory. Side effects experienced included anxiety during the infusion and vomiting and one patient fainted. Episodes of suicidal behaviour occurred during the study – not unusual given the patients were severely depressed – but the researchers said suicidal ideas diminished overall. "The main thing we are having to work on now is maintenance strategy to try to prolong the responses [to ketamine]," he said. "It's a controversial area but there's no doubt that it's got potential." He did not anticipate the reclassification of the drug causing any problems, noting that it is already widely used in relief of chronic pain in the UK.***********************************************************************It seems like a no-brainer that stress may make us more likely to succumb to viruses and other infections, but that’s a tough connection to make scientifically.For starters, it would not be ethical to test the idea by putting people under extreme stress and exposing them to dangerous infections in the laboratory. But some scientists have nonetheless found ways to study the problem. Their findings show that the picture is more complicated than the notion that too much stress can overwhelm the immune system. Hormones biologically express our emotions, says Jan Kiecolt-Glaser, a psychologist at the Ohio State University College of Medicine and a pioneer in this field. Stress hormones are part of the “fight or flight” response that primes your body for battling a saber-toothed predator or avoiding a car crash. “But if stress is chronic every day, pumping out hormones without any escaping or fighting, then it’s not good for your immune system,” impairing its response to infection, Kiecolt-Glaser says. And Americans’ chronic stress isn’t going away. The American Psychological Association’s 2013 Stress in America online survey showed that 84 percent of participants reported stress levels equal to or higher than those in the previous year. Yet only 35 percent report managing their stress well. Research by Kiecolt-Glaser and others has shown that stress doesn’t necessarily suppress the immune system, but it does hamper the body’s ability to respond to infections appropriately. Kiecolt-Glaser and her colleagues use vaccination as an ethical way to compare immune responses in people with different stress levels. Vaccines give each person the same exposure to a “foreign invader” and cause a predictable production of antibodies. In 1998, her team showed that stressed people — students about to take a medical board exam and caregiving spouses of Alzheimer’s patients — took longer to develop protective antibodies after vaccination than did other students or spouses. Sheldon Cohen, a health psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, wanted to know what those immune changes meant when a chronically stressed person was exposed to an actual infection. So his team measured the stress levels of healthy volunteers through questionnaires, then exposed them to nasal drops containing cold viruses. Over the next five days, they determined who had become infected and quantified their congestion and mucus production (by weighing the snot found in every used tissue). The more stress people reported — especially from ongoing personal conflicts or unemployment — the greater their likelihood of getting sick. Cohen’s group also showed that high-stress people infected with the flu virus produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines than their less-stressed peers. These cytokines are the molecular signals that recruit immune cells to the site of infection or injury and cause the cold symptoms of a runny nose and congestion. A small cytokine response can shut down an infection without any symptoms at all. But when your body produces too many of these molecules, you have a full-blown cold and its accompanying pile of tissues. In a 2012 study, Cohen’s group showed how chronic stress disables one of the body’s mechanisms for the cytokine off-switch. The bottom line, Kiecolt-Glaser says, is that “chronic stress makes it more likely you become infected and that infections will last longer and be nastier.” Other immunology experts are not so sure. Erwin Gelfand, an immunologist at National Jewish Health in Denver, has no doubt that stress causes small changes in immune cells or inflammatory molecules, but he’s skeptical that those changes are significant. “The immune system is very plastic and flexible. On balance, I think our immune system manages these perturbations,” he says. Otherwise, he reasons, most Americans would be sick in bed most of the time. “To say stress lowers our vulnerability to disease? That’s a quantum leap at this point,” Gelfand says. But Greg Miller, who studies how stress affects health, thinks the evidence is “as strong as it can be,” given the limitations of human laboratory studies. And it points, he says, to an evolving view of how stress impacts immunity — that perhaps stressed-out immune responses are too much of a good thing. “Immune cells are sloppy, and they make a mess,” calling in other cells and setting off chain reactions in the process of fighting infection or healing wounds, says Miller, a psychologist at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. With stress, that mess gets bigger, more out of hand, creating collateral damage. Scientists now think that immune overdrive, especially chronic high inflammation, explains why stress is linked to aging-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. “You have a lifetime of these overshot inflammatory responses and the damage they accumulate over the course of decades,” Miller says. So is there anything I can do to keep my immune system operating smoothly? Kiecolt-Glaser advises monitoring stress through such activities as controlled deep breathing, practicing mindfulness and talking to a therapist. In a study published last month, her team found that breast cancer survivors who did yoga twice a week for three months had lower levels of inflammatory molecules and slept better than similar women who did not. “Channel energy into more physical activity. Make more connections with friends,” Miller suggests. “None of that is high-tech.”***********************************************************************Try closing your eyes for a minute. Without the luxury of vision, your sense of hearing seems to kick into overdrive, with every rustle and stir sounding louder and clearer. Sit in darkness long enough and your brain may end up rewiring itself to turn you into a super-listener. A new study has found that mice kept in total darkness compensated for the loss in vision with an improved sense of hearing and more auditory connections in the brain. Also, the mice were adults, challenging the belief that only young, developing brains can so readily remold. In just one week, the rodents’ visually deprived brains had already adapted. Neurons responsible for processing sound fired stronger and faster and could pick up on a wider range of tones, compared with a control group. Their brains even grew more connections from the thalamus — sort of a gateway between our sense organs and the brain — to the auditory cortex. When the mice were returned to a normal light-dark cycle, their brains returned back to normal within about a week. This sensory compensation also extends to hearing loss. When mice were deafened, the opposite occurred: the link between the thalamus and the visual cortex strengthened.The mechanisms of how these brain areas manage to communicate remain a mystery. “There’s no connection between the primary visual cortex and the primary auditory cortex, so how is this working?” said University of Maryland biologist Patrick Kanold, author of the study published online Wednesday in the journal Neuron. “It’s an important question.” MIT neuroscientist Mark Bear, who was not involved in the study, agrees that there is no direct connection between the two areas of the brain — but there may be a roundabout route. “Given enough synapses, every neuron in the brain connects to every other neuron in the brain,” said Bear, who found the results surprising and interesting. Kanold hopes to explore this further with his collaborator, neuroscientist Hey-Kyoung Lee of Johns Hopkins University, citing this as a first experiment in a long line of future studies on the subject. “The most exciting part is that these changes were happening in adults, since it is long known that the adult brain is less plastic than a child’s,” Lee said.“We were really, really shocked.” Brain plasticity refers to the brain’s ability to remold and rewire itself throughout a lifetime. When we are young, our brains are still developing and are highly plastic — which is why, for example, learning new languages is much easier as a child. During that “critical period,” outside stimuli actively shape the brain, which uses the input to strengthen or prune specific synapses. Scientists once thought that after childhood, much of the brain became set in stone. Findings in the past few decades have proved that it remains more moldable than previously thought, even as we age. Lee and Kanold’s study adds another compelling piece of evidence supporting the existence of adult neuroplasticity. Lee stumbled upon this interplay between different sensory regions of the brain several years ago, while working on an earlier experiment. At that time, she was curious about how visual experiences are encoded by the brain and decided to see if vision deprivation in mice alters their brain circuitry. After inducing blindness, the visual cortex didn’t change — but surprisingly, the other sensory areas of the brain did. She wanted to explore this unexpected finding further and enlisted the help of her then-colleague Kanold, who is an auditory function expert. “Her lab was next to my office, so it was very natural to start a collaboration,” Kanold said. Next, Lee wants to explore whether there’s any way to make the changes more permanent to possibly help people with hearing loss — but she can’t say for certain that the same rewiring will happen in humans. “Mice have poor vision, and they have ultrasonic hearing,” she said, compared with humans. “But we believe that in the human brain, the same principle should work.” They can’t easily re-create the experiment with human subjects, but some behavioral studies have shown that indeed blindness leads to enhanced auditory abilities. For instance, the blind can localize sounds in 3-D space better and have the ability to discern pitch changes 10 times faster than sighted individuals. But as brain plasticity would dictate, performance often improves the younger the onset of blindness. Neurologist Krish Sathian of Emory University thought the experiments were “very nicely done” and speculates that their findings could one day help patients. “This study clearly reinforces the hope that such neuroplasticity can be harnessed for rehabilitative training of individuals with various kinds of sensory loss, such as visual or hearing loss,” he said.***********************************************************************That happy, invincible feeling you get when you're floating through the air at the peak of a workout? You've probably heard that it's something called endorphins that your body produced during prolonged exercise. That idea, which has been around since the ’80s, is based on the theory that these chemicals interact with receptors in the brain to reduce your perception of pain and some thought they may also give you that euphoric boost. A new study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences challenges that notion and puts forth a different theory: That that "high" it could be due to different substance called endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids can basically be thought of as the body's self-produced marijuana and, like cannabis, can impact a wide range of physiological processes, including appetite, pain, memory and mood. Now the new research was only in mice, so it's unclear how it will apply to humans, but what the researchers found is almost certainly intriguing enough to inspire followup studies. Researchers from the Central Institute of Mental Health of the University of Heidelberg took mice and gave them running wheels. They found that after the runs, the mice were less anxious and tolerated pain better. Then they used drugs to block the animals’ endocannabinoid system. The results were striking. The animals were as anxious after running as before running and more sensitive to pain. "We thus show for the first time to our knowledge that cannabinoid receptors are crucial for main aspects of a runner’s high," the researchers wrote. There's been a lot of other interesting research on the subject of runner's high recently. In August, scientists at the University of Montreal published their work on a different animal study involving the hormone leptin, which is nicknamed the "satiety  hormone." Leptin, which regulates energy stores, signals to the body when it has enough fuel and energy. The researchers said it's possible that when you are in the middle of a workout, your leptin levels may fall, and this could "send a hunger signal to the brain's pleasure center to generate the rewarding effects of running." In a study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, they compared normal mice with genetically engineered mice that lacked a leptin-sensitive protein called STAT3 that relays the leptin signal to release the reward chemical dopamine. The normal mice logged an average of six kilometers a day on a running wheel. But the genetically engineered mice ran nearly twice as much as the normal mice — 11 kilometers — each day. If these studies are confirmed, the big question out there is whether these beneficial effects one day be bottled to help people exercise more to improve their health. It's looking more and more like a possibility.***********************************************************************Genetic changes stemming from the trauma suffered by Holocaust survivors are capable of being passed on to their children, the clearest sign yet that one person’s life experience can affect subsequent generations. The conclusion from a research team at New York’s Mount Sinai hospital led by Rachel Yehuda stems from the genetic study of 32 Jewish men and women who had either been interned in a Nazi concentration camp, witnessed or experienced torture or who had had to hide during the second world war. They also analysed the genes of their children, who are known to have increased likelihood of stress disorders, and compared the results with Jewish families who were living outside of Europe during the war. “The gene changes in the children could only be attributed to Holocaust exposure in the parents,” said Yehuda.Her team’s work is the clearest example in humans of the transmission of trauma to a child via what is called “epigenetic inheritance” - the idea that environmental influences such as smoking, diet and stress can affect the genes of your children and possibly even grandchildren. The idea is controversial, as scientific convention states that genes contained in DNA are the only way to transmit biological information between generations. However, our genes are modified by the environment all the time, through chemical tags that attach themselves to our DNA, switching genes on and off. Recent studies suggest that some of these tags might somehow be passed through generations, meaning our environment could have and impact on our children’s health. Other studies have proposed a more tentative connection between one generation’s experience and the next. For example, girls born to Dutch women who were pregnant during a severe famine at the end of the second world war had an above-average risk of developing schizophrenia. Likewise, another study has showed that men who smoked before puberty fathered heavier sons than those who smoked after. The team were specifically interested in one region of a gene associated with the regulation of stress hormones, which is known to be affected by trauma. “It makes sense to look at this gene,” said Yehuda. “If there’s a transmitted effect of trauma, it would be in a stress-related gene that shapes the way we cope with our environment.” They found epigenetic tags on the very same part of this gene in both the Holocaust survivors and their offspring, the same correlation was not found in any of the control group and their children.Through further genetic analysis, the team ruled out the possibility that the epigenetic changes were a result of trauma that the children had experienced themselves. “To our knowledge, this provides the first demonstration of transmission of pre-conception stress effects resulting in epigenetic changes in both the exposed parents and their offspring in humans,” said Yehuda, whose work was published in Biological Psychiatry. It’s still not clear how these tags might be passed from parent to child. Genetic information in sperm and eggs is not supposed to be affected by the environment - any epigenetic tags on DNA had been thought to be wiped clean soon after fertilisation occurs. However, research by Azim Surani at Cambridge University and colleagues, has recently shown that some epigenetic tags escape the cleaning process at fertilisation, slipping through the net. It’s not clear whether the gene changes found in the study would permanently affect the children’s health, nor do the results upend any of our theories of evolution. Whether the gene in question is switched on or off could have a tremendous impact on how much stress hormone is made and how we cope with stress, said Yehuda. “It’s a lot to wrap our heads around. It’s certainly an opportunity to learn a lot of important things about how we adapt to our environment and how we might pass on environmental resilience.” The impact of Holocaust survival on the next generation has been investigated for years - the challenge has been to show intergenerational effects are not just transmitted by social influences from the parents or regular genetic inheritance, said Marcus Pembrey, emeritus professor of paediatric genetics at University College London.“Yehuda’s paper makes some useful progress. What we’re getting here is the very beginnings of a understanding of how one generation responds to the experiences of the previous generation. It’s fine-tuning the way your genes respond to the world.”Can you inherit a memory of trauma? Researchers have already shown that certain fears might be inherited through generations, at least in animals. Scientists at Emory University in Atlanta trained male mice to fear the smell of cherry blossom by pairing the smell with a small electric shock. Eventually the mice shuddered at the smell even when it was delivered on its own. Despite never having encountered the smell of cherry blossom, the offspring of these mice had the same fearful response to the smell - shuddering when they came in contact with it. So too did some of their own offspring. On the other hand, offspring of mice that had been conditioned to fear another smell, or mice who’d had no such conditioning had no fear of cherry blossom. The fearful mice produced sperm which had fewer epigenetic tags on the gene responsible for producing receptors that sense cherry blossom. The pups themselves had an increased number of cherry blossom smell receptors in their brain, although how this led to them associating the smell with fear is still a mystery.***********************************************************************A 2,000-year-old mechanical computer salvaged from a Roman shipwreck has astounded scientists who have finally unravelled the secrets of how the sophisticated device works. The machine was lost among cargo in 65BC when the ship carrying it sank in 42m of water off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera. By chance, in 1900, a sponge diver called Elias Stadiatos discovered the wreck and recovered statues and other artifacts from the site. The machine first came to light when an archaeologist working on the recovered objects noticed that a lump of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. Closer inspection of material brought up from the stricken ship subsequently revealed 80 pieces of gear wheels, dials, clock-like hands and a wooden and bronze casing bearing ancient Greek inscriptions. Since its discovery, scientists have been trying to reconstruct the device, which is now known to be an astronomical calendar capable of tracking with remarkable precision the position of the sun, several heavenly bodies and the phases of the moon. Experts believe it to be the earliest-known device to use gear wheels and by far the most sophisticated object to be found from the ancient and medieval periods. Using modern computer x-ray tomography and high resolution surface scanning, a team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at Cardiff University peered inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine. Detailed imaging of the mechanism suggests it dates back to 150-100 BC and had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the moon and the sun through the zodiac, predict eclipses and even recreate the irregular orbit of the moon. The motion, known as the first lunar anomaly, was developed by the astronomer Hipparcus of Rhodes in the 2nd century BC, and he may have been consulted in the machine's construction, the scientists speculate. Remarkably, scans showed the device uses a differential gear, which was previously believed to have been invented in the 16th century. The level of miniaturisation and complexity of its parts is comparable to that of 18th century clocks. Some researchers believe the machine, known as the Antikythera Mechanism, may have been among other treasure looted from Rhodes that was en route to Rome for a celebration staged by Julius Caesar. One of the remaining mysteries is why the Greek technology invented for the machine seemed to disappear. No other civilisation is believed to have created anything as complex for another 1,000 years. One explanation could be that bronze was often recycled in the period the device was made, so many artefacts from that time have long ago been melted down and erased from the archaelogical record. The fateful sinking of the ship carrying the Antikythera Mechanism may have inadvertently preserved it. "This device is extraordinary, the only thing of its kind," said Professor Edmunds. "The astronomy is exactly right ... in terms of historic and scarcity value, I have to regard this mechanism as being more valuable than the Mona Lisa." The research, which appears in the journal Nature today, was carried out with scientists at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens where the mechanism is held and the universities of Athens and Thessaloniki.***********************************************************************Like all the best cryptography, the Enigma machine is simple to describe, but infuriating to break. Straddling the border between mechanical and electrical, Enigma looked from the outside like an oversize typewriter. Enter the first letter of your message on the keyboard and a letter lights up showing what it has replaced within the encrypted message. At the other end, the process is the same: type in the “ciphertext” and the letters which light are the decoded missive. Inside the box, the system is built around three physical rotors. Each takes in a letter and outputs it as a different one. That letter passes through all three rotors, bounces off a “reflector” at the end, and passes back through all three rotors in the other direction. The board lights up to show the encrypted output, and the first of the three rotors clicks round one position – changing the output even if the second letter input is the same as the first one. When the first rotor has turned through all 26 positions, the second rotor clicks round, and when that’s made it round all the way, the third does the same, leading to more than 17,000 different combinations before the encryption process repeats itself. Adding to the scrambling was a plugboard, sitting between the main rotors and the input and output, which swapped pairs of letters. In the earliest machines, up to six pairs could be swapped in that way; later models pushed it to 10, and added a fourth rotor.Despite the complexity, all the operators needed was information about the starting position, and order, of the three rotors, plus the positions of the plugs in the board. From there, decoding is as simple as typing the cyphertext back into the machine. Thanks to the reflector, decoding was the same as encoding the text, but in reverse.But that reflector also led to the flaw in Enigma, and the basis on which all codebreaking efforts were founded: no letter would ever be encoded as itself. With that knowledge, as well as an educated guess at what might be encrypted in some of the messages (common phrases included “Keine besonderen Ereignisse”, or “nothing to report” and “An die Gruppe”, or “to the group”), it was possible to eliminate thousands of potential rotor positions. Eventually, the team at Bletchley Park built a machine, the Bombe, which could handle that logical analysis. But the final steps were always performed manually: the job of the Bombe was merely to reduce the number of combinations that the cryptanalysts had to examine. Even as the Allied code-breaking team were working on Enigma, the Axis was improving its machines, adding more and different rotors, and minimising operator error. Eventually, the Enigma was superseded by the Lorenz. These required yet more codebreaking in Britain, and more automation to do it – leading to the production of Colossus, the world’s first digital programmable computer.***********************************************************************The internet of things has many advantages, but when machines start collecting data, privacy and security become an issue. When we hand over data to a company most people realise there is a value exchange. The organisation gets to learn more about us for future communications, but in return they are able to deliver our shopping, get in contact if there is a problem or keep us up to date with special offers. There are very clear data collection guidelines that companies and public bodies must abide by. The Data Protection Act 1998 is detailed but the main points are that information must only be used for the reason that has been given, it must be accurate, stored securely to protect privacy, and it must only be held onto as long as it is needed. However, it’s a different ball game when it comes to ‘things’ collecting data. Estimates vary as to how many devices are currently collecting data and connected to the internet. One recent study estimates 13bn – and that number will nearly double within five years. For businesses, governments and consumers alike, the internet of things (IoT) brings with it a great deal to look forward to: smart cities, better healthcare through remote sensors, and better ways of targeting customers – it could be an ice cream after they emerge from a hot train or, just as likely, an umbrella. However there are concerns that once machines start monitoring local conditions, as well as us, we’re handing over a lot of data without perhaps realising it. Regulatory minefield:  Once machines start to take data rather than humans, multiple watchdogs and regulators start to get involved. “Just imagine smart meters which are great for reducing energy use and shrinking bills,” says Mark Thompson, privacy practice leader at KPMG. “You could have the energy regulator, Ofgem, involved as well as Ofcom, because the data’s going over a broadband connection. Then, because there’s data involved, the Information Commissioner’s Office is bound to have an interest. Then when that data starts crossing boundaries you could have a perfect storm of countries not always having the same security and privacy standards yet having multiple regulators involved.” Security standards: Not only is there a privacy concern, but data security is an issue too. William Webb is a visiting professor at Surrey University and heads a special interest group, the Weightless SIG, which is working on standards to secure data collected and sent over the internet by gadgets. He warns that if the data is not secure, hackers could cause serious damage. “We’re devising a way of ensuring communications are authenticated as coming from the device as well as encrypted to avoid eavesdropping,” he says. “We’re also working on a means to ensure gadgets can be ‘patched’ like a computer if a security flaw is unveiled. Privacy aside, it’s vital we get communications secure or else terrorists could use smart city technology to send people to a particular route or train, and pranksters could cause mayhem altering settings, such as convincing a local authority bins need emptying, when they don’t.” Privacy matters: One potential solution, on the privacy side at least, is to separate the identity of the person being measured by a sensor from the data they generate. John Taysom, a fellow of the University of Cambridge and co-founder of privacy company Privitar, believes this “disassociation” is key because companies and governments get the data without a risk to privacy. He fears, though, that organisations might rush in too soon before realising the potential for compromising an individual’s private details. “There’s obviously a lot of concern about privacy but I think we’re in one of those situations like smoking or sugary foods,” he says.“The gain to getting all that data is very instant but the problems seem a long way off, and so you end up not being firm enough with guidelines until further down the line and governments have to step in to set rules. You shouldn’t forget that ultimately the machines taking the readings and transmitting them are owned by companies which want to use that information. Although we’re talking about sensors, we’re really talking about the people and companies that own them.” Smart Finns: The European commission has been very keen to start trial projects to show the power of IoT in building smarter cities. Its Horizon 2020 programme has provided a British team led by Peter Matthews, lead research scientist at CA Technologies, to work with the Technical University of Tampere in Finland. The researchers are ensuring the security of data transmitted by sensors throughout the Finnish city, which allow residents to plan journeys according to live travel conditions. “Just like you don’t want someone to hack your pacemaker, you’ve got to make sure that sensors are what they say they are and they’re talking only to the proper service, not hackers,” Matthews says. “We’re finding, as the project grows in scale, the real complication is starting to come from combining your own sensors with others. So, measuring how things are going on the road and rail network is one thing. It’s when you then combine it with a person’s digital diary, to arrange travel around meetings, or a weather service, so they know if they need an umbrella – that’s where you start to need the really robust systems that we’re currently developing.” The promise of the IoT is vast, but so too is the potential for security flaws and privacy lapses. It is one of the reasons why the Data Protection Act is being replaced through the EU’s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which is expected to be finalised before the end of the year before being added to the statute books of member countries next year. It is expected to bring in tighter rules to ensure data is only used for the primary reason it has been given and also increase fines for companies who suffer data privacy lapses.***********************************************************************Google has turned its Google Maps Street View into a time machine to let users travel back in time and see how places have changed. The new feature will let users track changes in landscape, buildings, roads and entire neighbourhoods from around the world since the Street View mapping program began in 2007. Users can now click on a new clock icon that will appear in the corner of the screen when using Street View on Google Maps on a desktop or laptop computer, firing up scrollbar-controlled time machine, changing the year and even season of the area or building they are currently looking at to see how it has changed over time. 'A time traveller like Doc Brown': "If you've ever dreamt of being a time traveller like Doc Brown, now's your chance," said Google Street View product manager Vinay Shet in a blog post. "We've gathered historical imagery from past Street View collections dating back to 2007 to create this digital time capsule of the world." Google's Street View uses car-mounted cameras to capture street-level photos of the world, stitching the images together into a virtual representation of the real world overlaid on Google's maps. Google's cars have driven across most of the world, but this is the first time the search giant has made more than one version of the resulting images available to the public. "Now with Street View, you can see a landmark's growth from the ground up, like the Freedom Tower in New York city or the 2014 World Cup stadium in Fortaleza, Brazil," said Shet.'A digital timeline of recent history': "This new feature can also serve as a digital timeline of recent history, like the reconstruction after the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Onagawa, Japan. You can even experience different seasons and see what it would be like to cruise Italian roadways in both summer and winter," he said. Street View has primarily been used as a way of visualising directions to help users find and identify locations they are looking for, but the service has become increasingly popular among "armchair explorers", who have used Street View to discover far away parts of the world without ever leaving home. Google has been adding tourism and beauty hotspots to the service for some time, as well as the insides of some public places like train stations, airports and brick and mortar stores allowing users to view the inside of buildings too. Google recently announced that it was to begin using a new algorithm that can read the house numbers in images on the service, and then correlate these with real addresses in order to improve the accuracy of addresses supplied in Google searches.***********************************************************************Europe’s highest court said on Tuesday that people had the right to influence what the world could learn about them through online searches, a ruling that rejected long-established notions about the free flow of information on the Internet. A search engine like Google should allow online users to be “forgotten” after a certain time by erasing links to web pages unless there are “particular reasons” not to, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said. The decision underlined the power of search companies to retrieve controversial information while simultaneously placing sharp limits on their ability to do so. It raised the possibility that a Google search could become as cheery — and as one-sided — as a Facebook profile or an About.me page. Jonathan Zittrain, a law and computer science professor at Harvard, said those who were determined to shape their online personas could in essence have veto power over what they wanted people to know. “Some will see this as corrupting,” he said. “Others will see it as purifying. I think it’s a bad solution to a very real problem, which is that everything is now on our permanent records.” In some ways, the court is trying to erase the last 25 years, when people learned to routinely check out online every potential suitor, partner or friend. Under the court’s ruling, information would still exist on websites, court documents and online archives of newspapers, but people would not necessarily know it was there. The decision cannot be appealed. In the United States, the court’s ruling would clash with the First Amendment. But the decision heightens a growing uneasiness everywhere over the Internet’s ability to persistently define people against their will. “More and more Internet users want a little of the ephemerality and the forgetfulness of predigital days,” said Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, professor of Internet governance at the Oxford Internet Institute. Young people, in particular, do not want their drunken pictures to follow them for the next 30 years. “If you’re always tied to the past, it’s difficult to grow, to change,” Mr. Mayer-Schönberger said. “Do we want to go into a world where we largely undo forgetting?” The court said search engines were not simply dumb pipes, but played an active role as data “controllers,” and must be held accountable for the links they provide. Search engines could be compelled to remove links to certain pages, it said, “even when the publication in itself on those pages is lawful.” The court also said that a search engine “as a general rule” should place the right to privacy over the right of the public to find information. Left unclarified was exactly what history remains relevant. Should a businessman be able to expunge a link to his bankruptcy a decade ago? Could a would-be politician get a drunken-driving arrest removed by calling it a youthful folly? The burden of fulfilling the court’s directives will fall largely on Google, which is by far the dominant search engine in Europe. It has more than 90 percent of the search business in France and Germany. Google said in a statement that the ruling was “disappointing” and that the company was “very surprised” it differed so much from a preliminary verdict last year that was largely in its favor. The decision leaves many questions unanswered. Among them is whether information would be dropped only on Google sites in individual countries, or whether it would be also erased from Google.com. Even as Europe has largely erased its internal physical borders, the ruling could impose digital borders. Another open question is how much effort a search engine should reasonably spend investigating complaints. “I expect the default action by search engines will be to take down information,” said Orla Lynskey, a lecturer in law at the London School of Economics. A trade group for information technology companies said the court’s decision posed a threat to free expression. “This ruling opens the door to large-scale private censorship in Europe,” said James Waterworth, the head of the Brussels office for the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which counts Facebook, Microsoft and Google among its members. “While the ruling likely means to offer protections, our concern is it could also be misused by politicians or others with something to hide.” That view was echoed by Big Brother Watch, a London-based civil liberties group that was perhaps the first to invoke the specter of Orwell. “The principle that you have a right to be forgotten is a laudable one, but it was never intended to be a way for people to rewrite history,” said Emma Carr, the organization’s acting director. Mr. Mayer-Schönberger, the author of “Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age,” said such concerns were overblown. He said the court was simply affirming what had been standard European practice. Relatively few people in Europe have had issues with wanting to delete information on the Internet, Mr. Mayer-Schönberger said. “I don’t think this will lead to the end of the Internet as we know it.” Michael Fertik is chief executive of Reputation.com, which helps people improve their search results into something they find less objectionable. “For the first time, human dignity will get the same treatment online as copyright,” Mr. Fertik said. “It will be protected under the law. That’s a huge deal.” The only loser, he said, was Google. “It no longer gets to profit from your misery.” And perhaps Reputation.com. “This ruling is not necessarily favorable for my business,” he said. Those who worry that many people might use the ruling to erase information that is detrimental but is unquestionedly accurate may find support in the case that began it. The case started in 2009 when Mario Costeja, a Spanish lawyer, complained that entering his name in Google led to legal notices dating to 1998 in an online version of a Spanish newspaper that detailed his debts and the forced sale of his property. Mr. Costeja said the debt issues had been resolved many years earlier and were no longer relevant. So he asked the newspaper that had published the information, La Vanguardia, to remove the notices and Google to expunge the links. When they refused, Mr. Costeja complained to the Spanish Data Protection Agency that his rights to the protection of his personal data were being violated. The Spanish authority ordered Google to remove the links in July 2010, but it did not impose any order on La Vanguardia. Google challenged the order, and the National High Court of Spain referred the case to the European court. Mr. Costeja’s lawyer, Joaquín Muñoz, said Tuesday’s ruling was a victory not only for his client, but for all Europeans. “The fundamental point is that consumers will now know what the rules of the game are and how to defend their rights,” he said.***********************************************************************Nearly half of all edits to articles about places on Wikipedia were made from just five countries, researchers at the University of Oxford have found. The UK, US, France, Germany and Italy are the source of 45% of the edits on “geocoded” Wikipedia articles, which have a longitude and latitude associated with them to link them to a specific place in the world. And the Netherlands alone – which doesn’t even fit in the top ten countries by number of edits – still has more edits to its name than all of Africa combined. The researchers, led by Dr Mark Graham from the university’s Oxford Internet Institute, argue that the study shows that “local voices rarely represent and define their own country”. Instead, high-income countries have a disproportionately loud voice on the crowd-sourced encyclopedia, so countries that have many Wikipedia editors can “dominate the production of knowledge about smaller countries”. They looked specifically at articles about places to focus on the “uneven geographies of participation”. It may be tricky to argue where an article about theoretical physics should be edited from, but there is no debate over whether or not the editor of an article about a location in Nairobi is local if they aren’t based there. To make matters worse, of the small number of edits that do come out of poorer countries, many are about Europe and North America, further entrenching the knowledge dominance of the developed world over the content of Wikipedia entries. Graham said that: “Even on Wikipedia, widely touted as one of the web’s most open and most inclusive platforms, we see that low-income countries are represented far less than locations that are economically advantaged. Europe and North America, with already high levels of internet access have the loudest voices and they largely define the world view of even the smaller, less affluent countries rather than the people who live in them. “In practice, we see how existing inequalities and imbalances don’t just make places invisible, but also suffocate certain voices and perspectives. Even those in less economically advantaged places are drawn to write online about places that are already highlighted in a bright glow of information production.” Where possible, the researchers looked at data from every one of the 300-plus languages Wikipedia is written in. But even the inclusion of editions such as the Sotho, Xhosa and Fijian Hindi can’t overcome the bias amongst the userbase. Wikipedia has long been fighting to tackle a lack of diversity among its pool of editors, which frequently filters through to the choice of articles created and expanded. The Royal Society, one of Britain’s oldest scientific institutions, holds an annual “edit-a-thon” in an attempt to redress the site’s gender imbalance. The events are having an effect: in the four years they’ve been run, the Royal Society has run out of female fellows to create articles for, having to move on to more obscure female scientists such as 18th-century illustrators Sarah Stone and Maria Sibylla Meriam. Even so, the event is little more than a drop in the ocean. By most estimates just one in 10 of Wikipedia’s editors are female, even though its readership is split 50-50. Similarly, fewer than 1% of Wikipedia editors self-identified as trans in 2011, and the site has been criticised for creating a hostile terrain for those editors. Most recently, a heated row broke out when WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning came out as trans, which eventually led to multiple editors being banned from editing pages related to trans issues.***********************************************************************Seven-year-old Jordan Lisle, a second grader, joined his family at a packed after-hours school event last month aimed at inspiring a new interest: computer programming. “I’m a little afraid he’s falling behind,” his mother, Wendy Lisle, said, explaining why they had signed up for the class at Strawberry Point Elementary School. The event was part of a national educational movement in computer coding instruction that is growing at Internet speeds. Since December, 20,000 teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade have introduced coding lessons, according to Code.org, a group backed by the tech industry that offers free curriculums. In addition, some 30 school districts, including New York City and Chicago, have agreed to add coding classes in the fall, mainly in high schools but in lower grades, too. And policy makers in nine states have begun awarding the same credits for computer science classes that they do for basic math and science courses, rather than treating them as electives.There are after-school events, too, like the one in Mill Valley, where 70 parents and 90 children, from kindergartners to fifth graders, huddled over computers solving animated puzzles to learn the basics of computer logic. It is a stark change for computer science, which for decades was treated like a stepchild, equated with trade classes like wood shop. But smartphones and apps are ubiquitous now, and engineering careers are hot. To many parents — particularly ones here in the heart of the technology corridor — coding looks less like an extracurricular activity and more like a basic life skill, one that might someday lead to a great job or even instant riches. The spread of coding instruction, while still nascent, is “unprecedented — there’s never been a move this fast in education,” said Elliot Soloway, a professor of education and computer science at the University of Michigan. He sees it as very positive, potentially inspiring students to develop a new passion, perhaps the way that teaching frog dissection may inspire future surgeons and biologists. But the momentum for early coding comes with caveats, too. It is not clear that teaching basic computer science in grade school will beget future jobs or foster broader creativity and logical thinking, as some champions of the movement are projecting. And particularly for younger children, Dr. Soloway said, the activity is more like a video game — better than simulated gunplay, but not likely to impart actual programming skills. Some educators worry about the industry’s heavy role: Major tech companies and their founders, including Bill Gates and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, have put up about $10 million for Code.org. The organization pays to train high school teachers to offer more advanced curriculums, and, for younger students, it has developed a coding curriculum that marries basic instruction with video games involving Angry Birds and hungry zombies. The lessons do not involve traditional computer language. Rather, they use simple word commands — like “move forward” or “turn right” — that children can click on and move around to, say, direct an Angry Bird to capture a pig. Across the country, districts are signing up piecemeal. Chicago’s public school system hopes to have computer science as a graduation requirement at all of its 187 high schools in five years, and to have the instruction in 25 percent of other schools. New York City public schools are training 60 teachers for classes this fall in 40 high schools, in part to prepare students for college. “There’s a big demand for these skills in both the tech sector and across all sectors,” said Britt Neuhaus, the director of special projects at the office of innovation for New York City schools. The city plans to expand the training for 2015 and is considering moving it into middle schools. The movement comes with no shortage of “we’re changing the world” marketing fervor from Silicon Valley. “This is strategically significant for the economy of the United States,” said John Pearce, a technology entrepreneur. He and another entrepreneur, Jeff Leane, have started a nonprofit, MV Gate, to bring youth and family coding courses developed by Code.org to Mill Valley, an affluent suburb across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. Parents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that they see as productive, Mr. Pearce said. “We have any number of parents who say, ‘I can’t take my kid playing one more hour of video games,’ ” he said. But if the children are exploring coding, the parents tell him, " ‘I can live with that all night long.’ ” The concept has caught on with James Meezan, a second grader. He attended one of the first “Hour of Code” events sponsored by MV Gate in December with his mother, Karen Meezan, the local PTA president and a former tech-industry executive who now runs a real estate company. She is among the enthusiastic supporters of the coding courses, along with several local principals.Her son, she said, does well in school but had not quite found his special interest and was “not the fastest runner on the playground.” But he loves programming and spends at least an hour a week at CodeKids, after-school programs organized by MV Gate and held at three of Mill Valley’s five elementary schools. James, 8, explained that programming is “getting the computer to do something by itself.” It is fun, he said, and, besides, if he gets good, he might be able to do stuff like get a computer to turn on when it has suddenly died. His mother said he had found his niche; when it comes to programming, “he is the fastest runner.” Other youngsters seemed more bewildered, at least at first. “The Google guys might’ve been coders, and the Facebook guys — I don’t know,” said Sammy Smith, a vibrant 10-year-old girl, when she arrived at the coding event at Strawberry Point. But well into the session, she and her fifth-grade friends were digging in, moving basic command blocks to get the Angry Bird to its prey, and then playing with slightly more complex commands like “repeat” and learning about “if-then” statements, an elemental coding concept. The crowd had plenty of high-tech parents, including Scott Wong, director of engineering at Twitter. His 7-year-old son, Taeden, seemed alternately transfixed and confused by the puzzles on the laptop, while his 5-year-old brother, Sai, sat next to him, fidgeting. The use of these word-command blocks to simplify coding logic stems largely from the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, which introduced a visual programming language called Scratch in 2007. It claims a following of millions of users, but mostly outside the schools. Then, in 2013, came Code.org, which borrowed basic Scratch ideas and aimed to spread the concept among schools and policy makers. Computer programming should be taught in every school, said Hadi Partovi, the founder of Code.org and a former executive at Microsoft. He called it as essential as “learning about gravity or molecules, electricity or photosynthesis.” Among the 20,000 teachers who Code.org says have signed on is Alana Aaron, a fifth-grade math and science teacher in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. She heard about the idea late last year at a professional development meeting and, with her principal’s permission, swapped a two-month earth sciences lesson she was going to teach on land masses for the Code.org curriculum. “Computer science is big right now — in our country, the world,” she said. “If my kids aren’t exposed to things like that, they could miss out on potential opportunities and careers.”***********************************************************************Independent booksellers are being sent reinforcements in the battle against Amazon with a website that will support the dwindling band of high street traders, backed by the world's largest publisher. My Independent Bookshop, a social network for book lovers from Penguin Random House, launches on Thursday as an online space where anyone can review their favourite books and show off their good taste on virtual shelves. Crucially, readers can also buy books from the site, with a small proportion of takings going to support scores of local independent book stores. Around 70 shops are connected to the site so far and Penguin Random House hopes several hundred will eventually sign up. A reader's nominated home store – which doesn't have to be geographically close – will get 5% of the revenues from every physical book they buy and 8% on an ebook. The site is a tie-up with the e-commerce website Hive, which has been offering a similar service to local shops since 2011. Terry Pratchett described My Independent Bookshop as "a very, very good thing", and other authors such as Lisa Jewell, Alastair Campbell, Irvine Welsh and Tony Parsons have registered on the site during a month-long testing phase. Dan Franklin, digital publisher at Penguin Random House, said national chains, such as Waterstones or Foyles, had not been included in an attempt to recreate the independence and quirkiness of non-chain bookshops. Franklin said the publishing giant would not make money from the website, but saw other benefits. "The data is very valuable. We can see what's trending, what books are popular and how people are interacting." He described the site as "a way of having a more direct conversation with consumers", who will have the chance to compete for prizes from rare proof copies to attending author events. The venture underscores how publishers are seeking a closer relationship with readers, as the book world goes through its biggest upheaval since the invention of high-speed printing presses and the railways. Publishers find they are competing with an ever increasing array of entertainment choices on smartphones and mobile devices, while high street bookshops have been closing their doors in the face of cut-throat competition from Amazon and supermarkets. Recent data revealing that fewer than 1,000 independent bookshops remain in the UK raised alarm bells about the future of the industry. Franklin said the Penguin Random House venture was not intended to rival Amazon. "Amazon is a partner of ours and it is in our interest to support what they do." The publisher has decided against using "intrusive" algorithms – favoured by Amazon - to suggest books readers might like. Instead recommendations will come from the site's users with the aim of creating a "serendipitous way of discovering books". The publisher is staying tight-lipped about the target number of users for this "desert island discs for books" – but is hoping large numbers of book lovers will sign up, as well as organisations. The site's creators are also counting on readers' natural curiosity to peer onto other people's book shelves. Several readers and authors have already created a personal page – "a bookshop" – showcasing 12 books they like. Pratchett has chosen books by fellow sci-fi hit authors Douglas Adams and Neil Gaiman, but also praises Lynne Truss's punctuation book Eats, Shoots & Leaves – "I come back to this over and over again," he writes on the site. Tony Parsons's page is themed around crime novels and thrillers, while the author of Trainspotting, Irvine Welsh, has created a list that includes Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov and George Orwell's Keep the Aspidistra Flying – "a completely harrowing and stark account of poverty", he writes of the grim story of a downtrodden would-be poet in 1930s London. Alastair Campbell has not yet revealed the contents of his shelf, although the former New Labour spin doctor and author of several works of fiction and non-fiction has registered on the site. The venture could be a shot in the arm for independent stores, such as Hayling Island Bookshop in Hampshire, selected by Pratchett as the shop to profit from his orders. Pratchett launched his novel Nation in the shop in 2008, but Colin Telford, the store's events manager, said staff were astonished when they heard the best-selling fantasy author had chosen them. He said it was too early to tell how far Hayling Island could gain but expects "some additional income from people we wouldn't normally see". Telford said the decline in independent bookshops had probably reached its limits, as those booksellers remaining turn to events, cafes and social media to draw in shoppers. "Those independent bookshops that are still going are probably going to survive because they have worked out their survival strategy."***********************************************************************Sometimes parenting is a survival game and, like our evolutionary predecessors fending away wolves with burning sticks, we’ll take just about any tool at our disposal. For me, bleary-eyed and exhausted, my five-month-old son asleep in my arms at four o’clock in the morning, that tool was an exercise ball to bounce him back to sleep (we later graduated to a rocking chair). It’s not perfect. I still need to be awake and somewhat attentive but it does the job, especially as he’s a relatively good sleeper anyway. But recently, while trying to settle him, I stumbled across a better solution online: the Snoo baby crib rocks an upset baby back to sleep and then slows down to keep him or her soothed and snoozing. It picks the ideal white noise for the situation. A combination of sleep deprivation and the angelic glow of my smartphone screen gave the crib a nearly Messianic quality. At last, a tool to give all of us some sleep. By this stage I’d been settling for two hours. Through the delirium my mind started racing: it’s all well and good to be able to rock a baby back to sleep – what if you could put them in fully awake and have the crib do all the work? Could artificial intelligence work out how to feed a bottle? It’d need a refrigeration unit but that shouldn’t be too difficult … In my desperate madness, I proceeded to design a machine that would effectively make me redundant in my son’s life for the next few months. The logic of technological entrepreneurship is the logic of progress: once we’ve found a way to technologise something, we want to know how far we can push it. Cars can double as chauffeurs, phones as personal assistants, cribs as parents, the list goes on. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with technological innovation. Engineering is precisely the art of providing tools to allow humans to get on with the business of being human without being impeded by unnecessary inconvenience. But technology always primes social values in particular ways. It’s unlikely that technological disruptions of parenting will be any different. Just as global access to information has changed our appetite to pay for news, technologies that make parenting easier can prompt unexpected behaviour. For instance, with parents able to get a good night’s sleep quickly and easily, there may be less pressure for secondary carers – often fathers – to take additional time off work to help care for their partner and child. Might this surreptitiously displace working parents from the home earlier than they otherwise might have chosen? A number of new families I’ve met have joked about how eager the mother was to send their partner back to work to have them “out of the way” – technology like this might expedite the process. On the bright side, it might also provide much-needed relief to single parents and those working multiple jobs to make ends meet; providing them the opportunity to rest, explore other opportunities for income or take some time for self-care. Yet those who need to work two jobs are also those with the least discretionary income to spend on robotic cribs for their children. Although good in theory, the crib might not be available to those who need them most until they can be produced cheaply at scale. There is also a question as to how this and similar technologies could alter our conceptions of parenting itself. When I contemplated fatherhood, part of what I was committing to was bleary-eyed, sleepless nights trying to wrestle a little one back to bed. This wasn’t a necessary evil, it was a defining aspect of being a parent – an exercise of self-sacrifice, presence and solidarity with my partner. If, as Snoo promises, “exhaustion is optional”, will manually settling your child move from an essential part of parenting into a fringe activity done by purists? If so, there might be unforeseen consequences. Once I returned to work after my paternity leave, settling my son back to sleep was on some days the only time I had with him. LED–illuminated cuddles were the only moments I had with my boy; but I was exhausted and, if presented with another option, I might have been tempted – a decision I might have regretted knowing what I do now. For me, giving up my sleep was the only tangible way I could connect to my son and my new role as a father. Perhaps our baby wouldn’t have been any worse off soothing in a crib – though I suspect there’d be fierce debate on that point. But I have a feeling my parenting might have. Until recently, sleep rituals, nappy changes and burping weren’t menial tasks that distracted from the real business of parenting; they were the defining experiences of it. In many ways, they still are. Maida Lynn Chen, director of the Pediatric Sleep Center at Seattle children’s hospital, thinks similarly. She told the Washington Post, “There are certain triumphs to parenting, such as figuring out your child’s cues and being able to soothe your baby in some shape or form. Really developing and growing, as a parent, your skill set to try to figure out [why the baby is crying], I think that’s part of the parenting process.” Andy Warhol advised people to allow the things that bore them to become thrilling instead. I’m not sure if he had parenting in mind but he may as well have. Technology can make our lives easier but to pursue ease and comfort merely because we can might also make them emptier. I feel a thrill when my son falls asleep in my arms. In my better moments, I feel a thrill when he grunts to announce he’s awake. With the wisdom of perspective, they aren’t thrills I’d trade for smaller bags under my eyes. And I’m not sure what kind of a dad I’d be if I did.***********************************************************************Amazon may be set to bring its hi-tech till-free stores to the UK after registering the Amazon Go brand name in the UK last week. At the test store near Amazon’s HQ in Seattle, an app tracks customers as they walk about, recording the items they pick up and take away. The store is currently only available to company staff, but will open to shoppers from next year. The cost of purchases will be automatically billed to their account. The company has registered the Amazon Go trademark in the UK for an extensive list of potential uses, from technology, telecommunications and retail services to food and drink services and even pet food. The retailer claims the Amazon Go store is “the world’s most advanced shopping technology” but other businesses are also trialling shop-assistant-free concepts. The Näraffär convenience store based in an isolated village in Sweden, for example, relies on a mobile app which lets residents access the store, scan their shopping and then pay via a monthly invoice. They’re part of a wave of new gadgetry which could dramatically change the way we shop: Robot assistants. Some may argue that many stores have these already, but retailers are moving on, with a view to replacing staff with sophisticated software. The American DIY chain Lowe’s is testing LoweBot, a customer service robot that speaks several languages, helps shoppers find items and provides information on products. First trialled as OSHbot two years ago, it is currently being tested in 11 Lowe’s stores. US electricals retailer Best Buy has Chloe, a robot that is a glorified grabber arm for CDs and DVDs, while Aldebaran Robotics, part of the Japanese telecoms firm Softbank, has created Pepper, a humanoid robot which has been deployed in some Nescafé stores in Japan. Some US shopping centres are even adopting robotic security guards – a cross between a CCTV camera and a Dalek that can detect people who may be loitering in the wrong place and read car number plates in car parks. But it’s not all been straightforward: a robot guarding a shopping centre in California recently ran over a toddler after its navigational scanning systems failed to detect the small boy. A virtual you. For many shoppers, buying clothes online is a very hit-and-miss affair. Sizes vary between outlets and getting the right fit means many clothing items are returned – which is bad for both the shopper and the shopkeeper. That could change thanks to new software that creates an accurate 3D model of the shopper, meaning it is possible to “try on” clothes. Cambridge based startup Metail, which has raised $20m to date and is backed by Hong Kong clothing giant Tal, is setting the pace. The company’s technology can be plugged into retailers’ websites so customers can create what it calls “Me Models” as well as 3D images of the products on sale. Shoppers can then find out if a pair of tight jeans will give them a muffin top. Retailers will also be able to use customer data to suggest outfits, creating a “Netflix style” shopping experience. Digital butlers. Doing the shopping may soon require nothing other than a shiny little box. Nearly all the major tech firms, including Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook, are developing digital home assistants that respond to voice commands. As an online retailer, it’s not surprising that Amazon has ensured its Echo device is easy to shop with – thanks to the Alexa app, which lets you shout out a shopping list, to add to a virtual trolley, as you walk around the house. Eventually these assistants should learn what you want and when you want it without commands. But these devices may be very shortlived – because home appliances like fridges, coffee machines and printers have already been developed that are linked to the internet so they can automatically replenish themselves without any interaction with their owner.***********************************************************************
