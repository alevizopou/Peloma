The English top flight&apos;s next three-year set of domestic and international broadcast deals are due to be auctioned next year. Some experts believe it is only a matter of time before <Organization gate:gateId="2072" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization>, <Location gate:gateId="2073" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="region" gate:matches="2002;2032;2035">Amazon</Location> and other deep-pocketed digital businesses decide to take on the likes of <Organization gate:gateId="2074" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">BT</Organization> and <Person gate:gateId="2076" firstName="Sky" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" surname="Sports" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="2004;2046">Sky Sports</Person>.

As the world&apos;s largest free-to-air platform, the company&apos;s huge reach and wealth have already started to make their mark on the sports industry in terms of broadcast partnerships and marketing deals. The California-based firm already has broadcast deals with Major League Baseball, <Organization gate:gateId="2085" orgType="other" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Major League Soccer</Organization> and the World Surf League and recently made an unsuccessful £450million bid to broadcast cricket&apos;s <Organization gate:gateId="2086" rule="LocOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1998;2008;2015;2036" kind="orgName">Indian Premier</Organization> League. In the first six months of this year, <Organization gate:gateId="2087" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization> broadcast more than 3,500 different sports events live, ranging from a partnership with <Organization gate:gateId="2088" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Fox</Organization> Sports for Champions League games in the <Location gate:gateId="2089" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">United States</Location>, to Mexican league football games and college lacrosse. In April, a global audience of five million watched a Barcelona-Real <Location gate:gateId="2090" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Madrid</Location> legends match, while &apos;<Person gate:gateId="2091" firstName="Hala" rule="PersonLocAmbig" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" surname="Madrid" kind="fullName">Hala Madrid</Person>&apos;, a behind-the-scenes look at Real shot on GoPro cameras, has become an online hit. But, most intriguingly, <Organization gate:gateId="2092" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization> has also just launched a new platform for video content in the <Location gate:gateId="2093" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">US</Location> called &apos;Watch&apos;, which <Location gate:gateId="2094" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="2009;2025;2028">Reed</Location> said is ideal for sport as it combines &quot;episodic, longer-form viewing&quot; with the conversation and engagement that is the cornerstone of <Organization gate:gateId="2095" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization>&apos;s appeal. There is also no disputing how important <Organization gate:gateId="2096" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization> has become to the industry, with several clubs and leagues using the platform to drive sales of merchandise and tickets, and a number of broadcasters also using targeted adverts to remind users to tune into live sport on television. These relationships are only going to grow and <Location gate:gateId="2097" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="2009;2025;2028">Reed</Location> also explained how <Organization gate:gateId="2098" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization> was talking to the <Organization gate:gateId="2099" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXKey" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">International Olympic Committee</Organization>, and almost every global sports federation, about the opportunities the platform offers sports that currently struggle to get on television. That is not to mention the sports rights traditional broadcasters simply waste by not having an outlet through which to show them. All this said, however, there are several obvious obstacles to <Organization gate:gateId="2100" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization>, <Location gate:gateId="2101" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="region" gate:matches="2002;2032;2035">Amazon</Location> or anybody else in the digital space making a serious play for live football rights, which is why many seasoned observers of the rights market believe a major shake-up is unlikely next year. So far, neither <Organization gate:gateId="2102" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization> nor <Location gate:gateId="2103" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="region" gate:matches="2002;2032;2035">Amazon</Location> has bid for any content as expensive as <Organization gate:gateId="2104" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1998;2008;2015;2036">Premier</Organization> League rights and there are doubts about how they would make their money back, particularly <Organization gate:gateId="2105" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1997;2001;2006;2011;2013;2017;2023;2026;2027;2029;2031;2034;2037">Facebook</Organization> and its open platform/online advertising model. <Location gate:gateId="2106" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Manchester</Location> <Organization gate:gateId="2075" rule ="UnknownJobTitlePerson" orgType ="company">United</Organization> chief executive <Person gate:gateId="2107" rule="PersonJobTitle" kind="fullName" ruleFinal="PersonFinal">Ed Woodward</Person> recently said clubs were expecting the digital giants to enter the fray next year, a view supported by the chief executive of the world&apos;s largest advertising company <Organization gate:gateId="2108" orgType="company" rule="OrgContext1" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="2041;2069">WPP</Organization> at the Leaders in Sport conference in <Location gate:gateId="2109" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="2005;2042" kind="locName">London</Location> on Wednesday.
