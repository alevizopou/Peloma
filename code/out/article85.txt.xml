  in the <Organization gate:gateId="508" orgType="government" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">House of Representatives</Organization> legislation proposed by the
  Reagan administration to slash the <Location gate:gateId="509" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="481;486">U.S.</Location> sugar price support, a
  spokesman for <Person gate:gateId="503" matchedWithLonger="true" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="483;498">Porter</Person> said.
      The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
  changes from the administration&apos;s proposal sent to <Organization gate:gateId="510" orgType="government" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Congress</Organization>
  last month.
      That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
  cents per pound from 18 cents now. <Person gate:gateId="506" rule="Unknown" matchedWithLonger="true" gate:matches="497;499;500" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Sugar</Person> growers would be
  compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
  to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
  growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
      Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
  proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.
