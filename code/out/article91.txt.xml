  The Zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  <Location gate:gateId="876" rule="LocKey" kind="locName" ruleFinal="LocFinal">northern Copperbelt</Location> to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
      However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
      Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
      Residents in the <Person gate:gateId="881" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="870;871;872;874" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Copperbelt</Person> contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
      In <Location gate:gateId="877" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Lusaka</Location>, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.

  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
      The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which <Person gate:gateId="883" rule="Unknown" matchedWithLonger="true" gate:matches="854;873" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Kaunda</Person> adopted to replace <Location gate:gateId="882" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="850;856">Zambia</Location>&apos;s IMF austerity
  program.
      Labour leaders in the <Person gate:gateId="879" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="870;871;872;874">Copperbelt</Person> said last week gangs of
  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
  prices after today&apos;s deadline. Fifteen people were killed in
  the <Person gate:gateId="884" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="870;871;872;874" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Copperbelt</Person> during food riots last December after the
  government tried to lift maize subsidies.
