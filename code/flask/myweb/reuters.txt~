THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER
  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
  

*****EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO PREDICT - LONDON TRADE
  The outcome of today's European Community
  (EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after
  last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest
  ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100
  kilos, traders said.
      Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be
  smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view
  on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission
  accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators
  protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining
  factor in today's result, they added.
  

*****NORTH YEMEN CALLS SUGAR BUYING TENDER - TRADE
  North Yemen has called a buying tender
  for Saturday for the purchase of 30,000 tonnes of white sugar
  for arrival in June, traders said.
  

*****RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP
  Good rains of one to four inches in the
  past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
  the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
  Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
      As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
  severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
  December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
  season.
      Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
  beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
  since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
      Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
  than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
  said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
      Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
  and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
  some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
      Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
  towards the end of May, he said.
      The cane crush normally runs from June to December.
  

*****FRENCH TRADERS FORECAST EC SUGAR TENDER
  The European Community (EC) is expected to
  award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000
  and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last
  week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.
      They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50
  Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864.
      Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender
  was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award
  and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
  They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but
  declined to give a rebate figure.

*****U.K. INTERVENTION BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES
  A total 118,350 tonnes of current series
  white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496
  European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
  European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board
  said.
      Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in
  France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in
  Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.
      Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a
  projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total
  tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes.
      Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes
  being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy.
      Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season
  (1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks).
      Last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export
  under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864
  European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos.
  

*****DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED
  Roughly half of this year's expected
  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
  Netherlands, told Reuters.
      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
  added.
      "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start," he said.
      Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"
  and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
      This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
      Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
  allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.
  

*****EC COMMISSION DETAILS SUGAR TENDER
  The EC Commission confirmed it granted
  export licences for 118,350 tonnes of current series white
  sugar at a maximum export rebate of 46.496 European Currency
  Units (ECUs) per 100 kilos.
      Out of this, traders in France received 34,500 tonnes, in
  the U.K. 37,800, in West-Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in
  Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes.
  

*****EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY
  The maximum export rebate granted at
  yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over
  producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC
  intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC
  Commission sources said.
      The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
  118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous
  week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
      Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
  obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
  Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
  the sources said.
      They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had
  to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
  operators protesting that rebates are too low.
      Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.
  But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless
  the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.
