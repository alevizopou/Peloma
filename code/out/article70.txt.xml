  <Location gate:gateId="571" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="557;561">Thailand</Location>&apos;s trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the <Organization gate:gateId="572" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Business Economics Department</Organization> said.
      It said <Person gate:gateId="570" rule="SaysPerson">Janunary</Person>/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. <Location gate:gateId="569" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="557;561">Thailand</Location>&apos;s improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country&apos;s oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
