  <Person gate:gateId="879" firstName="Jorge" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Cardenas" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="843;875;876;877">Jorge Cardenas</Person>, manager of <Location gate:gateId="882" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Colombia</Location>&apos;s
  coffee growers&apos; federation, said he did not believe any
  important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of
  the <Organization gate:gateId="883" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXKey" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">International Coffee Organization</Organization> (<Person gate:gateId="885" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ICO" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="846;847;861" kind="firstName">ICO</Person>).
      The <Person gate:gateId="886" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ICO" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="846;847;861" kind="firstName">ICO</Person> executive board is set to meet in <Location gate:gateId="887" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="848;852" kind="locName">London</Location> from March
  31 and could decide to call a special council session by the
  end of April to discuss export quotas.
      &quot;It&apos;s going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has
  been happening in the market, but it&apos;s unlikely any major
  decisions are taken,&quot; <Person gate:gateId="884" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="843;875;876;877" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Cardenas</Person> told journalists.
      Earlier this month, talks in <Location gate:gateId="888" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" gate:matches="848;852" kind="locName">London</Location> to re-introduce export
  quotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.
      Colombian finance minister <Person gate:gateId="889" rule="PersonJobTitle" kind="fullName" ruleFinal="PersonFinal">Cesar Gaviria</Person>, also talking to
  reporters at the end of the weekly National <Organization gate:gateId="890" orgType="unknown" rule="OrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Coffee Committee</Organization>
  meeting, said the positions of <Location gate:gateId="891" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="856;858;860">Brazil</Location> and of the <Location gate:gateId="892" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">United States</Location>
  were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.
      <Location gate:gateId="893" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="856;858;860">Brazil</Location>&apos;s coffee chief <Person gate:gateId="878" rule="PersonSays">Jorio Dauster</Person> said yesterday <Location gate:gateId="894" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="856;858;860">Brazil</Location>
  would not change its coffee policies.
      <Person gate:gateId="880" rule="PersonSays" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="male" gate:matches="843;875;876;877">Cardenas</Person> said the market situation was getting clearer
  because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile
  levels of producers.
      He said according to <Person gate:gateId="895" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ICO" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="846;847;861" kind="firstName">ICO</Person> statistics there was a shortfall
  of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October,
  the start of the coffee year, and February.
