Usain Bolt is closer to achieving his lifelong ambition of becoming a professional footballer after agreeing to train with Borussia Dortmund. The nine-time Olympic gold medallist has made no secret of his desire to swap spikes for studs ever since establishing himself as history’s greatest-ever sprinter. Now, in an interview with The Guardian, Bolt has claimed that he and his representatives have “genuinely been talking to people” about the possibility of transitioning to football after retiring from athletics. The interview reveals that Bolt has been in touch with Thomas Tuchel, the Dortmund head coach, who agreed to let him train with the Bundesliga club. The 30-year-old Jamaican wishes to “see what happens” once he has worked with Tuchel, but has his eyes set on a move to Manchester United, the club he supports. Bolt has talked up a move to Old Trafford in the past and was the club’s guest of honour for a Premier League clash with Fulham in 2012 following his success at the London Olympics. “For me, if I could get to play for Manchester United, that would be like a dream come true,” he told The Guardian. “Yes, that would be epic.” Last year, Bolt claimed that he was good enough to at least be offered a trial by United, insisting: “I am fit, I am quick, I can control the ball and I understand all of the play. “I think if I do a trial then they would say, 'You know what, here is a contract for five years! You are 30 years old, here's a five-year contract. Let's just do it!’,” he told MUTV. Bolt welcomed the appointment of Jose Mourinho as United’s manager earlier this year and, once again, claimed he deserved a chance to play under the Portuguese. "I haven't got the call yet, but I know it's coming. I think he's waiting until after the Olympics," Bolt said in July.
