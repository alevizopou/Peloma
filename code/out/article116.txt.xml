EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA
  European coffee roasters and traders
  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
  <Organization gate:gateId="1475" orgType="unknown" rule="OrgXKey" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">International Coffee Organization</Organization>, <Person gate:gateId="1476" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ICO" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="1435;1441;1456" kind="firstName">ICO</Person>, quotas, Dutch Coffee
  <Organization gate:gateId="1477" orgType="unknown" rule="OrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Trade Association</Organization> chairman chairman <Person gate:gateId="1478" rule="PersonJobTitle" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462" kind="fullName">Frits van Horick</Person> said.
      <Person gate:gateId="1479" firstName="Van" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Horick" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462">Van Horick</Person>, who is a council member of the European Coffee
  Federation, was speaking at the end of the <Organization gate:gateId="1474" rule ="AcronymOrg" orgType ="unknown">ECF</Organization> annual meeting.
      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
  would give <Location gate:gateId="1480" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1439;1445;1446;1459;1460">Brazil</Location>, the world&apos;s biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, <Person gate:gateId="1481" firstName="van" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Horick" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462">van Horick</Person> said.
      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  <Person gate:gateId="1482" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ICO" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="1435;1441;1456" kind="firstName">ICO</Person>, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, <Person gate:gateId="1483" firstName="van" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Horick" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462">van Horick</Person> said.
      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  <Location gate:gateId="1484" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1439;1445;1446;1459;1460">Brazil</Location>.
      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
      &quot;<Location gate:gateId="1485" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1439;1445;1446;1459;1460">Brazil</Location> has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to,&quot; <Person gate:gateId="1486" firstName="van" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Horick" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462">van Horick</Person> said.
      &quot;The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality,&quot; he said. &quot;Our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone.&quot;
      Although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  <Location gate:gateId="1487" locType="country" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Colombia</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1488" locType="country" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Kenya</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1489" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Indonesia</Location> and <Location gate:gateId="1490" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Costa Rica</Location> would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the <Location gate:gateId="1491" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Ivory Coast</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1492" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">El
  Salvador</Location> and <Location gate:gateId="1493" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Nicaragua</Location> would lose quota share, <Person gate:gateId="1494" firstName="van" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Horick" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462">van Horick</Person> said.
      Because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year&apos;s quota.
      &quot;If the <Person gate:gateId="1495" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ICO" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="1435;1441;1456" kind="firstName">ICO</Person> consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, &quot; <Person gate:gateId="1496" firstName="van" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Horick" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462">van Horick</Person> said.
      At the same time much will depend on <Location gate:gateId="1497" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1439;1445;1446;1459;1460">Brazil</Location>&apos;s attitude.
      &quot;<Location gate:gateId="1498" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1439;1445;1446;1459;1460">Brazil</Location> is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement,&quot; <Person gate:gateId="1499" firstName="van" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Horick" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1437;1438;1440;1442;1447;1455;1458;1462">van Horick</Person> added.
