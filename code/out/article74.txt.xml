FRENCH TRADERS FORECAST <Organization gate:gateId="427" orgType="other" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="412;413;414">EC</Organization> SUGAR TENDER
  The <Organization gate:gateId="428" orgType="other" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="412;413;414">European Community</Organization> (<Organization gate:gateId="429" orgType="other" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="412;413;414">EC</Organization>) is expected to
  award export licences at today&apos;s weekly tender for above 60,000
  and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last
  week&apos;s award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.
      They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50
  Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week&apos;s 46.864.
      Earlier, traders in <Location gate:gateId="426" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" kind="locName">London</Location> said the outcome of the tender
  was very hard to predict after last week&apos;s substantial award
  and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
  They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but
  declined to give a rebate figure.
