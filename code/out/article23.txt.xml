The survey, carried out by pollsters INSA for <Location gate:gateId="1236" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1186;1187;1193">Germany</Location>’s Bild newspaper, found <Person gate:gateId="1237" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" matchedWithLonger="true" surname="Merkel" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitle" title="Ms" gate:matches="1185;1188;1190;1194;1197;1201">Ms Merkel</Person>’s Christian democrats on 30 per cent, down three from the previous poll.

A German election polling average maintained by German newspaper <Organization gate:gateId="1240" orgType="newspaper" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Der Spiegel</Organization> has not had the <Organization gate:gateId="1230" rule ="AcronymOrg" gate:matches="1224;1225;1226;1227;1228" orgType ="unknown">SPD</Organization> ahead on average since late 2006. Though only the findings of a single poll, the latest results appear to be a symbolic watershed moment in <Location gate:gateId="1241" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="1186;1187;1193" kind="locName">Germany</Location> politics, which <Person gate:gateId="1242" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" matchedWithLonger="true" surname="Merkel" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitle" title="Ms" gate:matches="1185;1188;1190;1194;1197;1201">Ms Merkel</Person> has dominated for over a decade. The findings of a significant boost for the <Organization gate:gateId="1231" rule ="AcronymOrg" gate:matches="1224;1225;1226;1227;1228" orgType ="unknown">SPD</Organization> are also corroborated by another poll conducted by Emnid for Bild am Sonntag. That survey recorded a six-point jump for the <Organization gate:gateId="1232" rule ="AcronymOrg" gate:matches="1224;1225;1226;1227;1228" orgType ="unknown">SPD</Organization>, reportedly the biggest ever for the party in a single poll by that firm. The shifting electoral landscape comes just months ahead of crunch German Federal elections in September of this year – raising the possibility that <Person gate:gateId="1243" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" matchedWithLonger="true" surname="Merkel" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitle" title="Ms" gate:matches="1185;1188;1190;1194;1197;1201">Ms Merkel</Person> could be ousted as Chancellor after six months of Brexit negotiations. The boost to the <Organization gate:gateId="1233" rule ="AcronymOrg" gate:matches="1224;1225;1226;1227;1228" orgType ="unknown">SPD</Organization>’s fortunes appears to have been prompted by the appointment of <Person gate:gateId="1244" firstName="Martin" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Schulz" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="1198;1200;1206">Martin Schulz</Person>, former <Organization gate:gateId="1245" orgType="government" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">European Parliament</Organization> President, to the party’s leadership. <Person gate:gateId="1246" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" matchedWithLonger="true" surname="Schulz" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitle" title="Mr" gate:matches="1198;1200;1206">Mr Schulz</Person> has publicly presented a more hard-line approach again Britain and Brexit than <Person gate:gateId="1247" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" matchedWithLonger="true" surname="Merkel" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitle" title="Ms" gate:matches="1185;1188;1190;1194;1197;1201">Ms Merkel</Person>, having accused top <Organization gate:gateId="1248" orgType="political" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Tories</Organization> of having left “rubble behind them in a bid to fuel their personal ambitions”. He has also said that <Location gate:gateId="1249" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Brussels</Location> would need to “defend the interests of its citizens, just as the <Location gate:gateId="1250" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">UK</Location> will do”. The <Person gate:gateId="1251" rule="PersonTitleGenderUnknown" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" title="Chancellor" gender="unknown" surname="Merkel" kind="personName">Chancellor Ms Merkel</Person> has survived in part by adopting the policies of her opponents whenever they appear to be on the verge of finding a chink in her armour – posing the possibility that she might adopt <Person gate:gateId="1252" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" matchedWithLonger="true" surname="Schulz" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitle" title="Mr" gate:matches="1198;1200;1206">Mr Schulz</Person>’s more hardline anti-Brexit approach. The German federal elections come five months after <Location gate:gateId="1253" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">France</Location> picks its new President. The final round of that contest is likely to be between a centre-right candidate and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
