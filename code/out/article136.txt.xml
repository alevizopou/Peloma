  <Location gate:gateId="369" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="357;359">Japan</Location>&apos;s housing starts in February rose
  13.4 pct from a year earlier to 109,254, the 10th successive
  year-on-year gain, the <Organization gate:gateId="370" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Construction Ministry</Organization> said.
      February housing starts were up 16.8 pct from 93,554 in
  January when they fell 27.4 pct from a month earlier but rose
  10.3 pct from a year earlier.
      Higher housing starts were mainly due to a 26.8 pct
  year-on-year rise in apartment building starts to 51,829 for
  the 56th consecutive gain, spurred primarily by lower domestic
  interest rates.
