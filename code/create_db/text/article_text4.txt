The most popular New Year resolution in almost every survey is “exercise more” – which often translates into joining a gym. According to the 2016 State of the UK Fitness Industry report, one in seven people in the UK are members. But are they more likely to be fit? The solution: A study last week in the journal Plos One found that gym members were 14 times more aerobically active than people who didn’t belong to any health club. Gym members, on average, did six hours more exercise a week, and this activity did make them fitter than non-members. They had lower heart-rates, smaller waists and higher levels of cardiovascular fitness as measured by heart strength, lung function and muscle mass. They also spent less time sitting down every day than non-gym members. The results were similar for men and women. The study included 405 people between the ages of 30 to 64, and the general characteristics of those who were gym members were similar to those who were not. The lead author, Elizabeth C Schroeder of the department of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois, says that gym members were also more likely than non-members – even those who did exercise – to do resistance training which strengthens muscles, reduces blood pressure and can increase metabolic rates. While it might seem obvious that gym members exercise more, and are healthier than non-members, Schroeder says this has not previously been explicitly shown. “This study adds actual objective measures of people at a health club compared with non-members, which has not been measured prior [to now],” she says. However, the study is only designed to show a link between gym membership and more exercise – it may be that active people are just more likely to join gyms. People in the study who exercised as much as gym members had similar reductions in cardiovascular risk factors. You can get broadly the same benefit wherever you exercise. This study shows a gym membership makes it more likely you’ll do so, but other research shows that exercising outside has other benefits. Outdoor activity can boost your vitamin D levels, reduce tension and depression, and make you feel more revitalised and positive about life – especially if you run through a forest. Outdoor exercise is also rated as more enjoyable and less of an effort than going to the gym. The first five minutes of outdoor exercise are particularly effective at making people feel good. But Schroeder says that a gym may also encourage greater exercise because it can be social and fun.***********************************************************************Sleep has become the Shangri-La of modern times. Amid deadlines, demands and distractions, getting eight hours is akin to finding a mythical paradise. But a good night’s sleep may not be as elusive as it seems. All you need to do is swap your smartphone for a tent. A new study by US scientists has found that camping can help us sleep better and reset our body clock. A group of five people were sent into the mountains for six days with no gadgets, not even torches. The campers racked up nearly 10 hours sleep each night, almost three hours longer than they were used to getting at home. This result does not surprise me because spending time outdoors saved me from insomnia. For a mind-churning six months a few years ago I lived in a waking dream – or rather a nightmare. I spent my days trying to stay awake after a woeful night of restlessness. As evening drew on I became obsessed with making everything perfect for sleep. I would stock up on herbal sleep aids before bed. Despite this, my mind refused to switch off and I would wake up groggy. When sleep didn’t come I became frustrated, tired and emotional. Then something amazing happened. I went trekking in Slovakia’s High Tatra mountains, staying in small basic cabins every night. For the first time in months, sleep came to me like a warm, welcome hug. I had decided to make the trip because I hadn’t done anything like it since I was a teenager. I would spend the days walking and chatting, breaking only for food. When night came and we were thrust into pitch darkness my body relaxed and I was out for the count. When I came back home I was desperate for the good sleep to continue, but after a week the insomnia returned. I decided to go for a walk after work each day in the park and spend my weekends being active outdoors. After a few weeks I noticed my sleep improving again. I went further still, shutting artificial lights out of my room and ditching my smartphone and laptop before bed. Our bodies keep time using our internal clock, releasing the “sleep hormone” melatonin when it’s time to rest and cortisol when it’s time to wake. Traditionally, the sun has controlled our waking and sleeping system – as the sun rises melatonin production drops off and cortisol production goes up. But less natural light and more computer light confuses the body’s circadian rhythm (our biological clock) and messes up sleep. It was next to impossible to get wifi in the mountains, so with no way of going online, I switched off. This meant no artificial lights (apart from my torch). Like the campers in the US study I didn’t use my gadgets. But it’s not just getting more natural light that makes being outdoors beneficial. The biophilia hypothesis suggests humans have an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life. It’s believed that the deep affiliations we have with other life forms and nature as a whole are in our biology. Other studies have shown that taking part in nature-based activities can reduce stress and anxiety. Last year research conducted by the University of Essex found that green care initiatives (such as care farming, or the therapeutic use of farming practices, environmental conservation and social and therapeutic horticulture) can help people with mental health problems. It has also been found that having a view of trees and nature from a hospital window can decrease recovery time from surgery. I believe the therapeutic powers of nature come from the fact that being outdoors helps us feel connected to something greater than ourselves. We spend our lives obsessing over trivial problems but the natural world is indifferent to these daily struggles. The world keeps spinning whether I sleep or not. So for those who struggle to sleep, my advice is simple – if not a little cheesy. Go outdoors and find your Shangri-La.***********************************************************************Can we really train our brains? The hope that maybe we can is based on the idea of “brain plasticity”: that no matter how old you are, and how set in your ways, your brain is constantly changing to adapt to new experiences. Brain plasticity is based on a decade’s worth of hard science, which is how it came to spawn a billion-dollar brain training industry. But there’s a problem. When scientists look at whether brain training games actually make people smarter, the answer is very clear: no. I have spent the past two years trying to find out why this is and what, if anything, we can do to get the best out of our brains. Armed with a shopping list of improvements, from extending my attention span to upgrading my abysmal sense of direction, I went looking for science-based improvements. After being zapped with magnetic pulses, strapped into wearable brain aids and taught how to meditate, I’ve concluded that while brain games might make you better at the task you are practising, they won’t improve your overall brain “fitness”. But a new wave of neuroscience might offer a better way. In recent years, neuroscientists have been exploring the brain’s connectome – its wiring diagram – with the aim of finding out how areas are linked into networks, and how activity in these networks differs from person to person. This is important because differences in ability are likely to come down to how well the brain can combine information from different areas to create something that is greater than the sum of its parts. With this in mind, rather than aiming to strengthen particular areas, it makes more sense to work on learning to engage different circuits of the brain depending on the job at hand. This might sound harder to achieve than a quick go on a brain training game but, in my experience, it can be done. Working with scientists at Boston Attention and Learning Lab, I found that learning to focus for longer was not, as I imagined, about building strength in the circuits needed to concentrate. It was about learning to allow my brain to fluctuate between focusing hard and wandering off, which uses two different circuits (the dorsal attention network and the default mode network respectively). The training, which involved clicking on some images and ignoring others for 12 boring minutes at a time, was about practising balancing these two mental states to stay just focused enough. After trying it, I found the same skill applied to swimming in a pool on my own and in some forms of meditation. It could work for anything that takes focus, but not too much: perhaps playing an instrument, making something with your hands or singing in a choir. Similarly, I found that improving my maths ability wasn’t about doing numerical press-ups to get better at sums, but learning to control my terror of doing them. My fear was diverting brainpower from the circuits I needed to solve the problem, so the scientists in Boston zapped part of my brain’s emotional-control circuitry with electricity to dial it down, allowing me to divert power to where it was needed. Zapping isn’t strictly necessary – they told me slowing down and relaxing would probably do much the same. With this kind of research into how to engage our brains more effectively coming through, it feels premature to throw the idea of brain training out completely. Meaningful change is possible, but it will come, not from tinkering with the engines of our minds, but by learning how to drive.***********************************************************************My eldest daughter, Larissa, read her first words at three and could read wee picture books by the age of four – not a child you would ever expect to be dyslexic, and yet she is. She has a form of dyslexia called auditory processing disorder, which means the message from the ear to the brain is not always received clearly (nothing to do with hearing problems) and that certain tasks require a lot more effort from her than they should. An avid reader myself, I was saddened greatly when Larissa told me that she loved books but found reading so tiring it made her head ache. Despite only being nine at the time, she managed to explain to me that when she reads a sentence it is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle piece by piece – first, she has to absorb the words and then put them together before then struggling to process them into a picture in her head. We worked together, with the help of an auditory therapist, and managed to find ways to lessen her load. Larissa did most of the work, telling me what type of books were easier to read and what kind of format worked best for her. There are many types of dyslexia and, obviously, all children are different but there is much you can do to help your child to regain their confidence with literacy and to make reading a fun activity instead of something they dread. Larissa, 11, is now an avid and confident reader. Here are some things that helped us: Talk about their dyslexia openly and positively with them. Make sure they know that it is not a “bad” thing, nor does it mean they are any less intelligent – it is merely that their brains work differently. They will have strengths others don’t have. (I recommend The Dyslexic Advantage by Brock and Fernette Eide.) Help your child determine what reading genre they enjoy most – nothing seems like hard work when you are enjoying yourself. Choose books in which the story does not move along too slowly. Too many wordy descriptions and no action can cause a slump in attention. Opt for books with shorter chapters and vivid imagery – this will help them to stay focused and interested. Discuss the book with your child. Ask them what they liked about it and what they didn’t like – this will help you narrow down what type of books to choose next. Font size can be a problem for some children, as can the background colour. Overlays, or an electronic device for reading, can help as you can find the size of print that best suits.***********************************************************************I am the luckiest person in the world to have a mum like you. When I was growing up, you were the perfect mother. Our family was a safe, loving place full of laughter and fun, creativity and adventure. As a teacher you were well placed to inspire me to want to learn, explore and grow, always encouraging and supporting. You always put me first – you are so incredibly nurturing, so selfless. You have consistently made me feel so loved, as if I was your reason for being. What a wonderful, beautiful thing. Now I am an adult, you are my very best friend. When I had my own babies, you were my unstinting support – cleaning my house, filling my fridge with meals for my family, walking my newborn baby round and round in the sunshine and playing with my toddler so that I could catch up on sleep. We still laugh together, read the same books, watch the same TV. I can tell you anything. Except this: I can never measure up to the example you set for me. Since having children, I constantly compare myself with you, and always find myself wanting. I remember my perfect childhood, and it makes me horribly aware of all my failures as a parent. I love my children, I really do. But while you found parenthood joyful and precious – you have always told me that having young children was the happiest time of your life – I find it hard and exhausting, and often tedious. I  lose patience with my toddler, who has limitless energy but never listens. When I complain about him to you, you tell me that I was the same. But you have a smile on your face, and I know that you coped much better with my precociousness than I do with his. Once when I was changing a nappy, you were reminiscing that you would line my toys up along the side of my changing mat so that I could watch them while you changed me. You didn’t mean it as a criticism, but I feel like a terrible mother for not bothering to do things like that. I remember being very young, and sitting on your lap wrapped in a towel after my bath. You would sing me songs you made up just for me, and I felt like I was wrapped in love. When I get my young children out of the bath, I have to fight to get them dried and dressed and to brush their teeth while they wriggle and shout and drive me mad. How am I getting this so wrong? You are my shining example of motherhood, but I doubt my children will think of me that way. They will remember that I was cross, and a bit useless. I am tired, so very tired, all the time. I know if I rang you and told you how tired I was you would jump on a train and come up to help, because that’s the wonderful person you are. But you didn’t have a mother to help you out when you were raising your family. My need for you is just one more way in which I am less of a mother than you are. I know if I told you any of this you would be heartbroken, so I never will. I never want to cause you pain, because you have spent my whole life protecting me from pain. I will never feel less than lucky to have had you as my mum. You are the best person I know. I am just aware that I can never, ever live up to that.***********************************************************************One of the most quietly unsettling findings in psychology, for my money, is “verbal overshadowing” – a weird fact about memory that’s liable to make you wonder if anything you believe about your life is really true. The finding is this: putting your experiences into words – talking about them with others or writing them down – makes you less likely to recall them accurately. If you were to witness a mugging, say, then scribble a record of what you’d seen, you’d be more prone to misremember than if you’d written nothing. Or think of all those times you’ve told friends about that ridiculous thing your boss said, or how you felt when you heard the presidential election result, or what it was like when you went into labour: in all likelihood, none of those conversations fixed the experience more vividly in memory. They probably distorted them, so your recollections may bear little resemblance to the truth. This has consequences far graver than the accuracy of your anecdotes: Elizabeth Loftus, a leading researcher of verbal overshadowing, advocates for those wrongly convicted as a result. It’s a horrible irony: in trials we need eyewitnesses to give statements. Yet the act of giving a statement undermines your value as an eyewitness. On closer inspection, this psychological oddity starts to look less strange. Language, as the linguist Nick Enfield points out, pretty much exists in order to categorise things – to sift the chaos of reality into the pigeonholes provided by our pre-agreed words. (He chose verbal overshadowing as his answer to the Edge website’s annual question this year: “What scientific term or concept ought to be more widely known?”) And putting something in a pigeonhole means not putting it into others, by definition. To describe someone as having three dogs is to focus on what the animals share – they’re dogs – and to disregard the fact that they’re a great dane, a sheepdog, and a yorkshire terrier; or old or young, excitable or placid. The research on verbal overshadowing, Enfield writes, suggests this pigeonholing overwrites the previous memory: “When words render experience, specific information is not just left out, it is deleted.” Even the best writer must unavoidably misrepresent the world – we couldn’t communicate otherwise – and the work of Loftus and others seems to show this misrepresentation can be permanent. Yet this annoying feature of our brains is surely the flipside of an extremely useful one: the way that verbalising your problems – by keeping a journal, or just talking to yourself – renders them more manageable, whether or not you come up with solutions, or share what you’ve written. To put worries into words is to categorise them, and thus get them under control: the very fact you can express them means they haven’t entirely got the better of you. I’ve never managed to keep a diary, in the sense of a record of events, and verbal overshadowing implies it would warp my memories anyway. A journal, on the other hand, harnesses that effect: it works because it transforms the material. Words change things, and thereby us.***********************************************************************Movement is critical in our lives. Often, in order to grow or to overcome strife we need a sense of undergoing a passage or transition. Movement shifts perspective and, in so doing, provides clarity, firing up hope, drive and possibility. Anyone who has found themselves opening up to a friend on a long walk or road trip will be familiar with the sense of ease that comes from talking and moving at the same time. The words seem to flow, tumbling from story to story. Secrets, seldom shared before, can fall into the conversation with surprising ease. When silence comes it seems to be a natural part of the experience, too. Sometimes we refer to this as “emotion in motion”, the sensation of feeling full of and connected to our feelings as we move. We may begin to connect with feelings that are hidden deep down. As we start to move our emotions rise up, enlivened by the energy we exert and the story we are telling ourselves. It is as though the movement somehow becomes an enactment or performance of our inner emotions. This powerful process of walking or running with, into or through our feelings can be insightful and liberating, and is the bedrock of mindful running – or Dynamic Running Therapy (DRT). Mindful running uses the movement of your body to get you closer to what is going on inside you emotionally, helping you to both understand and process it better. It can also be adapted to whatever level of fitness you have as long as you are challenging yourself physically some degree some of the time. This means that if a walk is a struggle for you, that counts as DRT. Likewise, if sprinting is your thing then you can set that as your DRT pace. The goal is to find a level of challenge where the blood starts to flow a little faster. There is no need to push yourself too hard or to maintain the same pace throughout the session. Mindful running isn’t complicated or particularly challenging. You are not actively changing anything – merely noticing the tone of your inner dialogue and meeting whatever you find there with acceptance and patience, letting it pass on by naturally. It is an open-ended practice, continuing until you decide to stop. Movement is instinctive and written deep into our DNA. So, why learn from only the spoken word, or thoughts, when the moving body is so informative? The body screams out in communication and can tell you everything, from what makes you happy and sad to what you do with stress and anger. Your slumped posture reflects how heavily the world weighs down on you. The spring in your step today could be a consequence of your promotion yesterday. How you run may indicate how you move in the wider world, such as in your relationships or work life. Are you quick to start but tire rapidly? Are you consistently paced but just can’t let go? Or perhaps you’re all about the sprint finish, forgetting that the detail of how you start the run is important too? Part of mindful running is understanding and learning what your running style says about you. Unlike conventional running, it’s crucial to avoid “striving”. Striving is the bedfellow of anxiety and a modern curse of the first order. There is no use in trying to run as far as possible as fast as possible while understanding as much as possible. As you progress you will find your pace and your footing – don’t try to rush to the end.***********************************************************************My friend Jessie doesn’t use Tinder any more. Aside from the swipe-induced RSI and the serial ghosters, her main motivation for giving up the dating app was the time she matched with a man who sent her a threatening message. “He said: ‘I’m gonna fuck you from behind, and I don’t care whether you want to or not,’” she recalls. Unfortunately, threats of sexual assault and abuse against women are not uncommon on dating apps. Reports of crimes related to apps such as Tinder and Grindr in the UK have risen by 382% in the past five years with many inappropriate messages documented on blogs such as Bye Felipe and Instagram accounts such as Tinder Nightmare. For every sweet bachelor just looking for someone to share a two-for-one Pizza Express deal, there are plenty more firing off creepy or abusive messages into the semi-anonymous ether, from “requests” to “sit on my face” to illegally doxxing women who reject them by making their contact details public. Women behave abusively, but by and large this is a problem perpetrated by men and male-identifying app users. And so, as I and many of my female friends work our way through various dating apps known to womankind, I’m generally in favour of anything that is designed to keep us safe. Tinder – the biggest dating app of them all, which recently celebrated its fifth birthday – launched a new anti-harassment feature last week called Reactions: a selection of animated responses only available to female users, allowing them – among other things – to throw a virtual martini in the face of a user who is bothering them, or send a sarcastic eye roll. It is part of the company’s Menprovement initiative, launched with a video featuring US comedian Whitney Cummings, in which the company’s female employees decide that “calling out douchebags should be easy and fun”. Encouraging women to engage in conversation with the “douchebags” who threaten or demean them risks further enforcing the dangerous belief that flirting and abuse are two sides of the same coin. And then there is the pseudo-empowerment vibe: “It’s simple. It’s sassy. It’s satisfying,” says the company. But is it? Tinder say Reactions weren’t designed to fight harassment on the app: “To achieve that, we’ve instituted a number of initiatives across the board, including stricter community guidelines, new messaging standards for all users, and updated our reporting system to make it easier to use.... Tinder has a zero-tolerance policy on abuse and takes the appropriate actions to combat it.” I speak to Valerie Stark, CEO and co-founder of location-powered dating app Huggle about her strategies for combating harassment and, thankfully, her answer isn’t emojis but super-smart verification. “We’re using technology that maps 160 points on your face,” says Stark. “This is how we verify your profile. So you take a picture of yourself copying one of the gestures we show you on screen, then compare it against the pictures you uploaded.” This sense of accountability means men are less likely to make inappropriate comments – adding that, as a female app founder, women’s safety has been her priority from the start. “It was quite controversial to see [Tinder] try to move in that direction,,” she says. Likewise, Louise Troen, the international brand director of Bumble, whose USP is that women must message men first, is also keen to highlight the importance of keeping women safe. (Indeed, the app was founded by a former Tinder exec, Whitney Wolfe, after she sued the company for sexual harassment.) While Troen is reticent to comment on Wolfe’s former employer and its “different offering”, she stresses that Bumble has a zero-tolerance policy to abuse, adding that “as soon as you create a response to harassment through things like emojis or gifs, you almost end up lessening the severity of it”. Bumble previously went public in its response, publishing an open letter that outlined why a perpetrator of abuse, named as Connor, would never be allowed back. On the one hand, that Tinder – with about 50 million users a month – is trying to police its app, which can feel like a veritable wild west of fake profiles, scammers, creeps and narcissists, is surely a step in the right direction. But Reactions still puts the onus on users. Why not target male users, too, and ask them to moderate their behaviour or risk being turfed out? Tinder does have existing facilities to report abuse – but Reactions risks gamifying it. Yesterday I logged into Tinder and in my inbox, was a message asking if earlier that day I had been near a tube station, where this user thought they had seen me a few times before. I filed this under “pretty creepy”. I hovered over a Reaction of a big red cross with the word “strike” underneath but, rather than spurring the conversation on further, I opted to unmatch and block. Unlike a virtual slap on the wrist, it offered at least a little peace of mind.***********************************************************************Have you ever noticed how cheerful your cycling colleagues are when they arrive at work in the morning? That’s because their commute is quicker and cheaper, they are full of endorphins from the exercise, and they have avoided being crammed on to hot, overcrowded public transport. The good news is it’s actually very easy to follow their lead. Commuting by bike is an intimidating prospect for a lot of people, but it shouldn’t be. A surprisingly small amount of kit is required, starting, unsurprisingly, with a bicycle. If you own one already, use that. Just make sure you check that there is air in the tyres and that the brakes are in good condition, particularly if you haven’t ridden it recently. Ask a cycling buddy to help, book it in for a service at your local bike shop, or find a tutorial on YouTube – basic bike maintenance is easy, even for total beginners. If you don’t own a bike, consider a local cycle hire scheme. With 11,500 bikes, London’s Santander Cycles is the biggest in the country, but bikeshare systems are spreading, from nextbike in Glasgow, which is expanding this autumn, to Mobike and Ofo, which launched this summer in Manchester and Cambridge respectively and are set to expand further. The government’s Cycle to Work scheme, meanwhile, offers big savings on the price of a new bike: your employer buys the bicycle, which you then “hire” from them through salary sacrifice (the savings come from the fact that you’re not paying tax and NI on the fees), and you buy it outright at the end of the 12-month hire period. Once you have your bike sorted, there are a few other things to consider, in terms of clothing, accessories, and staying safe on the road. Front and back lights are a must – USB-chargeable ones avoid the hassle of changing batteries and are more environmentally friendly. If you choose to wear a helmet, brands like Bern, Sawako and Bobbin specialise in stylish models you won’t be embarrassed to be seen in. Helmet hair is unavoidable, but a can of dry shampoo in your desk drawer solves that problem. A pack of biodegradable baby wipes are also handy if you can’t shower at work. Drivers will see you more easily in bright clothes but there is no need to invest in a wardrobe full of Lycra. Wear whatever is comfortable – although long floaty skirts or wide-legged trousers are best avoided as they can get caught in the chain. Slip-on shoes can be hard to pedal in too, but pretty much anything else will work just fine. To avoid getting mucky en route, make sure your bike is fitted with mudguards, and if your workwear is too restrictive to cycle in, consider leaving a couple of outfits at the office that you can change into. A pair of padded shorts, though not essential, will make long commutes more comfortable. Panniers or a basket are easy to fit and convenient to use. A rucksack gives more flexibility, but it’s no fun arriving at work with a sweaty back and sore shoulders. It’s good to get into the habit of carrying a puncture repair kit and bike pump, particularly if your commute takes you through sparsely populated areas – in big cities you are probably OK without a repair kit, given the number of friendly independent bike shops that provide free-to-use pumps. Another invaluable bit of kit are bone-conducting headphones that allow you to listen to music or podcasts as you cycle but still hear everything around you. Your first commute can be scary, but advance planning helps. A route planning app like CycleStreets provides three options to choose from: the fastest route, the quietest route, or a balance of the two. Do a practice run on a day when you are not in a hurry, ideally not at rush hour, so you know what to expect, and take it easy the first few times you cycle to and from work. Or consider breaking up a long commute at first – cycling part of the way, leaving your bike at a station and taking public transport for the rest of the journey. There is no right way to commute by bike, and it’s not all or nothing. Cycling to work even once a twice a week will still save you time, make you healthier and open your eyes to aspects of your town or city you never noticed before.
