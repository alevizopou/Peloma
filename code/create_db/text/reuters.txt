THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER
  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
  billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
  64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
  

***********************************************************************EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO PREDICT - LONDON TRADE
  The outcome of today's European Community
  (EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after
  last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest
  ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100
  kilos, traders said.
      Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be
  smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view
  on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission
  accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators
  protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining
  factor in today's result, they added.

***********************************************************************RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP
  Good rains of one to four inches in the
  past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
  the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
  Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
      As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
  severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
  December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
  season.
      Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
  beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
  since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
      Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
  than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
  said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
      Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
  and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
  some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
      Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
  towards the end of May, he said.
      The cane crush normally runs from June to December.
  

***********************************************************************FRENCH TRADERS FORECAST EC SUGAR TENDER
  The European Community (EC) is expected to
  award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000
  and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last
  week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.
      They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50
  Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864.
      Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender
  was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award
  and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
  They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but
  declined to give a rebate figure.

  A total 118,350 tonnes of current series
  white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496
  European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
  European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board
  said.
      Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in
  France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in
  Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.
      Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a
  projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total
  tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes.
      Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes
  being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy.
      Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season

      Last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export
  under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864
  European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos.
  

***********************************************************************DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED
  Roughly half of this year's expected
  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
  Netherlands, told Reuters.
      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
  added.
      "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start," he said.
      Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"
  and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
      This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
      Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
  allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.
  

***********************************************************************EC COMMISSION DETAILS SUGAR TENDER
  The EC Commission confirmed it granted
  export licences for 118,350 tonnes of current series white
  sugar at a maximum export rebate of 46.496 European Currency
  Units (ECUs) per 100 kilos.
      Out of this, traders in France received 34,500 tonnes, in
  the U.K. 37,800, in West-Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in
  Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes.
  

***********************************************************************EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY
  The maximum export rebate granted at
  yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over
  producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC
  intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC
  Commission sources said.
      The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
  118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous
  week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
      Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
  obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
  Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
  the sources said.
      They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had
  to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
  operators protesting that rebates are too low.
      Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.
  But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless
  the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.

  Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced
  in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the
  Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a
  spokesman for Porter said.
      The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
  changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress
  last month.
      That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
  cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be
  compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
  to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
  growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
      Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
  proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.
  

***********************************************************************SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM
  A sugar mill which was this
  nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
  saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
  Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
      The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
  will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
  40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
  the company said.
      "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
  regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
  after April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.
      Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
  months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
  oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
  prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
  hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
      At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
  receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
  warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
  (45-kg) bags of sugar.
      "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
  We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.
      He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
  additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
      Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
  two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
      He said the government then began importing refined sugar
  at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
  the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
  Duvalier last year continued the policy.
      "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
  with smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.
      HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
  the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
      It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
  supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
  minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
      Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead,
  and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared
  Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

***********************************************************************HAITIAN CANE PLANTERS PROTEST SUGAR MILL CLOSURE
  About 2,000 sugar cane planters
  marched to Port-au-Prince to protest against the closure of
  Haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer.
      The Haitian American Sugar Company closed on Friday because
  of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said Haiti has been
  flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the
  Dominican Republic and refined U.S. Sugar from Miami.
      The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000
  small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The
  protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the
  closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.
  

***********************************************************************CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER
  The south China province of Guangdong is
  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and
  other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain
  to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
      The official magazine said the province's grain area fell
  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
      Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,
  bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part
  to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the
  magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.
      The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national
  farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under
  other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.
      It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and
  low productivity make grain the least profitable farm
  commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1
  hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan
  from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.
      It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only
  gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.
  

***********************************************************************ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT
  The Zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
      However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
      Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
      Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
      In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
      President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
      The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity
  program.
      Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of
  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
  prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in
  the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the
  government tried to lift maize subsidies.
  

***********************************************************************CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS
  China will not increase sugar imports
  substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
  and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
  domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
      "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
  last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
  be extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
      The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
  (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
      The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
  tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
  figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
  News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
      The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
  area under sugar was dropping.
      "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper
  said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
  nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
  is a major problem."
      A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
  south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
  area planted.
      He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
      The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
  of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
      The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
      Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
  with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
  falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
      The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
  official press has said.
      Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
      The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
      A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
  sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
  when the central government resumed control of imports.
      "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
  in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat
  said.
      The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
  consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
  as coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar is
  one factor determining import levels," he said.
      Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
  China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
      "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
  152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyer
  now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
  the open market."
      A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
  imports was price.
      "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
  foreign exchange restraints persist," he said.
      The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
  pct a year but "a communist government is in a much better
  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
  foreign exchange situation demands it."
  

***********************************************************************TIGHT FAR EAST FREIGHT SPACE HITS SUGAR MARKET
  The Far Eastern sugar market is being hit
  by a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to
  move raw sugar to various destinations, notably from Thailand,
  traders said.
      This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those
  areas. These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a
  tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against
  recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.
      Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments
  because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13
  raws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports.
      A cargo of Thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis July
  New York futures less 25 points for June/July 15 shipment,
  traders said. But others said this was old business.
  

***********************************************************************FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED
  Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim
  payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a
  move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
  under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.
      Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
  indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
  501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
  crop year.
      The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
  486,790 tonnes.
      For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
  harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
  Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
      Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
  a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
  the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
  for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
  by June 23.
      Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
  23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
      The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
  full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
  received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
      Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
  23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
  the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
  Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
      However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
  14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
  forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
  harvested by November 30, he said.
      Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance of
  the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
  balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
  end of crushing."
      Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
  estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
  for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
  The FDB rejected this request.
      Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefully
  consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
  hardship on a case-by-case basis."
      In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
  removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
  would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
      He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
  harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
  to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
  commencement of harvest.
      Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
  indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
  he added.
  

***********************************************************************FOUR SUGAR CARGOES SOLD TO CHINA YESTERDAY -TRADE
  Four cargoes of raw sugar were sold to
  China yesterday via the London trade to supplement the
  country's current nearby buying programme, traders said.
      The sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne c
  and f for July/August shipment or arrival in September, they
  said.
      Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total as
  much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy
  volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was
  involved.
      China was still believed to be in the market for more
  sugar, traders said.

  at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  "strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations."

***********************************************************************COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE
  Cold and wet weather in northern,
  western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
  growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
  countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.
      Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
  hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
  fields.
      But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has
  boosted sugar beet growth.
      Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
  development, Licht said.
      In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
  population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
  weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
  rated as slightly below normal.
      In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
  heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
      In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
  was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
  continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
  impossible.
      In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
  favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
      In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
  beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
      In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
  it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
  generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
      In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
  boosted beet development.
      Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes
  between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
  delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
  beets are maturing very early this year.
  

***********************************************************************FAIRLY HECTIC WEEK IN RAW SUGAR, WOODHOUSE SAYS
  It has been a fairly hectic trading week
  in raw sugar with China paying market levels for nearby
  shipments, London trader, Woodhouse, Drake and Carey, said in
  its weekly report.
      July shipment Thai raws traded to China early in the week
  at fob levels equivalent to 20/25 points discount to July New
  York futures, it said. Mid-week saw these same sales covered by
  the trade at 10/15 points discount.
      Enquiries for July/Sep 15 raw sugars then filtered in and
  here again, traded values rose quickly from 13 points premium
  to New York July up to 18, Woodhouse said.
      In the Western Hemisphere, both Dominican Republic and
  Mexican nearby raws were bid 15 points discount to July New
  York and offered five points under, but in limited trading, it
  said.
      All the action of the past week has been in the Far East
  raws market whereas the whites market saw little fresh prospect
  of nearby offtake, Whitehouse added.
  

***********************************************************************INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND
  The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is
  likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and
  possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian
  Nainggolan said.
      He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil
  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still
  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no
  decision on when to go ahead had been made.
      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
      "Several factors make us move cautiously," Nainggolan said.
  "We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."
      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
  added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to
  five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are
  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
  exchange officials said.
      The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
  official said a feasibility study was needed first. No
  decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April
  23, traders said.
      Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the
  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
  the exchange would help this.
      Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
      He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to
  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to
  encourage participation.
      Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
      Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9
  mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered
  locally, the latest exchange report said.
       Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905
  tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.
       Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and
  44 traders.
  

***********************************************************************COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE
  A Colombia government trade official has
  urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
  activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
      Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
  Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become
  what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
  Colombia's major export.
      The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987
  coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
  about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
  another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
  

***********************************************************************COFFEE COULD DROP TO 70/80 CTS, CARDENAS SAYS
  International coffee prices could drop to

  reached to support the market, Jorge Cardenas, manager of
  Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation said.
      Speaking at a forum for industrialists, he said one of the
  reasons was that the market was already saturated and that
  producers will have excess production and stockpiles of 39 mln
  (60-kg) bags in 1987.
      Today, May futures in New York settled at 107.90 cents a
  lb.
  

***********************************************************************COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN
  Colombia's coffee export registrations
  remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new
  marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,
  Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'
  association said.
      "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close
  registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told
  Reuters.
      On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and
  May for an unlimited amount.
      Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters
  had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,
  or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the
  average in recent years.
      He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national
  coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total
  of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by
  Colombia.
      "The only change that could happen is, because of the
  volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations
  would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.

***********************************************************************UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES
  Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)
  has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
  it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
      The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
  urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
  could sustain, the sources added.
      Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
  waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
  trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
  Kenyan port of Mombasa.
      Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
  holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
  coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
      The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
  and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
  for such delays, it added.
      Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
  commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
  -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
  current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
  billion.
      The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
  annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
      The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
  earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
  likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
      CMB officials have forecast that because the government has
  restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will
  produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
  September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

  Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five
  central american nations will participate in the two-day
  strategy session beginning May 4.
      The main topic will be reform of what many producing
  countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export
  quotas, Fernandez said.
      He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the
  real production and export potential of each country in the
  past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"
  production levels rather than recent harvests and crop
  estimates.

  if its export quota was reduced by the organization.
  

***********************************************************************RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA
  European coffee traders and roasters
  may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
  Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
  here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
      Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
  possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
  world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
  next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
      "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
  attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.
      However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
  which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
  week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
  re-introducing quotas.
      Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
  re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
  favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
  formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
  countries.
      The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
  close, and problems with some Government officials.
      Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
  Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
      Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
  re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
      "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
  end of the week to at least present a common European Community
  (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
  International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.
      "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
  only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"
  one official said.
      "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
  were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
  stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
  simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
  quota allocation is concerned," he added.
      Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
  likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
  pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
      "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
  consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
  re-introduction, " he said.
      "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
  negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader
  said.
      "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
  the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
  a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
  gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
  meeting in September," the official said.
  

***********************************************************************IBC DETAILS PLANS TO PAY CREDITORS
  The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
  IBC, gave details of its plans to pay the 18 companies that
  bought 630,000 bags of robusta coffee in the London market on
  its behalf last September.
      An IBC spokesman told Reuters that a 15 mln dlr loan from
  the Banco do Brasil would be used to pay five mln dlrs a month
  in June, July and August to creditors.
      He said an auction of coffee would raise additional money
  and added that a Reuter report on June 16 gave the wrong
  impression that the auction was necessary to raise part of the
  15 mln dlrs. No date has yet been set for the auction.
  

***********************************************************************EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA
  European coffee roasters and traders
  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee
  Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.
      Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee
  Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.
      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and
  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, van Horick said.
      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, van Horick said.
      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  Brazil.
      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
      "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.
      "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone."
      Although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
      Because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
      "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, " van Horick said.
      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
      "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement," van Horick added.
  

***********************************************************************COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S.
  A U.S. government trade official
  responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on
  coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian
  efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
      Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
  back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
  countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
  agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
      "There is one country which evidently still does not,"
  Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
  been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
      Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
  for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
  International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
      He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
  discussions with Colombian officials.
      While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
  Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
  Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.
      The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
  which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
  for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
  with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
      Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
  on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
  European coffee roasters and traders.
      Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
  said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
  averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
  the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
      The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
  unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the
  coffee market are used to set export limits.

***********************************************************************IVORY COAST WEATHER NO PROBLEM FOR 1986/87 CROPS
  Ivory Coast rainfall this season has
  been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
  production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily
  Fraternite Matin reported.
      The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
  conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
  Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
  there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
      Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
  in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
  especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin
  said.
      Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this
  month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
  compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
      Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
  had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
  need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
  been affected in some regions, it added.
      London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast
  1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,
  which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described
  early development of the new main crop as patchy.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year
  forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast
  due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated
  the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's
  4.33 mln bag harvest.
      Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee
  crop as "normal."
  

***********************************************************************INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION
  The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
  announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
  foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
  export earnings for export promotion abroad.
      The move is designed by the government to improve India's
  trade deficit.
      Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
  Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
  textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
  electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
  goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
      The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
  amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
  minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
      RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
  qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
  spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
  of annual export earnings.
      These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
  semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
  psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
      RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
  two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
  freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
      Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
  higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
  holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
  RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.
  

***********************************************************************DAUSTER SAYS CONSUMERS SHOULD KEEP OUT OF QUOTAS
  Consumer countries should not
  intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas,
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said.
      "Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of
  producers as has been traditional," Dauster, a delegate at the
  recent coffee symposium here, told journalists. "When consumers
  want to get involved, talks are much more difficult."
      The main consumer country the United States and main
  producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution
  when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in
  February.
      Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in
  September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its
  market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the
  hands of producer countries.
      "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year
  we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we
  are not in a position to do favours."
  

***********************************************************************U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED
  A voluntary compliance system for
  monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
  skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
  trade sources.
      "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
  the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
  became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
  analyst said.
      On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
  the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
  voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
  monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
      Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
  importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
  U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
  authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
  it will still be allowed entry.
      While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
  overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
  will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
  monitoring controls, trade sources said.
      "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
  to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
  U.S. Customs spokesman said.
      "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
  its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
  Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
  destination)," he said.
      Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
  importers will abide by the quota system.
      "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
  quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
       "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
  not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
  the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
  producers' hands."
      Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
  voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
  in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
  Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
  countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
  labelled.
      According to customs officials, several green coffee
  importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
  fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
  forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
  beans.
      "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
  one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
  their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
  circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
  Bernie Savaiko.
      Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
  pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
  the U.S. in the near term.
      "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
  have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
  seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
  much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
  threat," one trader said.
  

***********************************************************************IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS
  The Brazilian Coffee Institute
  (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
  submit details of past export performance in order that
  individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
      He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed
  acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
  to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
  performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
      Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
  months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
  used for calculating the export performace portion.
      The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
  participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
  individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
      He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
  Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
  Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
  on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
  premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
  sales declaration form.
      Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
  registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
  but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
  the week, opening registraions from Monday.
      A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the
  CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for
  allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
  the spokesman added.
      A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
  in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
  shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.
  

***********************************************************************ICO EXECUTIVE BOARD TO MEET EARLY NOVEMBER
  The International Coffee Organization
  (ICO) Executive Board is to hold a meeting on November 3/4, its
  first since export quotas were re-introduced early this month.
      An ICO spokesman said the session, for the first time under
  the chairmanship of Bruno Caron of France, will review the
  market situation and the operation of quotas.
      On November 5 the six exporters making up the ICO Board of
  Management of the Promotion Fund will review its program for
  the 1987/88 year (Oct/Sept) and items left over from 1986/87.
      On November 2 a six nation working group will consider
  stock verification in Papua New Guinea.
  

***********************************************************************COLOMBIA OPENS COFFEE REGISTRATIONS - LDN TRADE
  Colombia has opened export registrations
  for November coffee shipments, trade sources said. No further
  details were available.
  

***********************************************************************UGANDA PLANS TO EXPORT ROASTED COFFEE TO EUROPE
  Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to
  Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.
      A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of
  Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind
  and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in
  December and the factory should be ready by next October.
      He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee
  Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000
  tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also
  told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan
  from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.
      Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and
  expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
      Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit
  Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln
  (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the
  latest International Coffee Agreement.
      In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be
  substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.
      The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of
  which is used to produce instant coffee.
  

***********************************************************************COFFEE, SUGAR AND COCOA EXCHANGE NAMES CHAIRMAN
  The New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
  Exchange (CSCE) elected former first vice chairman Gerald
  Clancy to a two-year term as chairman of the board of managers,
  replacing previous chairman Howard Katz.
      Katz, chairman since 1985, will remain a board member.
      Clancy currently serves on the Exchange board of managers
  as chairman of its appeals, executive, pension and political
  action committees.
      The CSCE also elected Charles Nastro, executive vice
  president of Shearson Lehman Bros, as first vice chairman.
  Anthony Maccia, vice president of Woodhouse, Drake and Carey,
  was named second vice chairman, and Clifford Evans, president
  of Demico Futures, was elected treasurer.
  

***********************************************************************CARDENAS SEES NO MAJOR DECISIONS AT ICO MEETING
  Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's
  coffee growers' federation, said he did not believe any
  important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of
  the International Coffee Organization (ICO).
      The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March
  31 and could decide to call a special council session by the
  end of April to discuss export quotas.
      "It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has
  been happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major
  decisions are taken," Cardenas told journalists.
      Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce export
  quotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure.
      Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to
  reporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee
  meeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United States
  were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas.
      Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil
  would not change its coffee policies.
      Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer
  because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile
  levels of producers.
      He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall
  of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October,
  the start of the coffee year, and February.
