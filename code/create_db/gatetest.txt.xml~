Sitting in a small, computer-lined room trying to remember a succession of different-coloured words scrolling past on a screen doesn&apos;t sound like the cutting edge of scientific research. However, academics at the <Organization gate:gateId="2968" orgType="university" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">University of East London</Organization> are using word tests to assess the impact synaesthesia can have on memory – and the potential it might have to <Person gate:gateId="2969" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ward" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" kind="firstName">ward</Person> off the decline in cognitive function that can affect the elderly. Synaesthesia, the neurological condition that causes a blending of the senses – colours can be connected to letters and numbers, smells and tastes to music or touch to vision – has long been linked to creativity: famous synaesthetes include Sibelius and more recently Pharrell Williams and <Person gate:gateId="2970" firstName="Lady" rule="GazPerson" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" surname="Gaga" kind="fullName">Lady Gaga</Person>.But among the wider population it has remained a mysterious condition, although it is known to affect at least 4.4% of adults across its many forms.For instance, a grapheme-colour synaesthete might &quot;see&quot; the days of the week, letters and numbers as particular colours; a lexical-gustatory synaesthete will experience a particular taste in their mouth when they hear a given word; and an odour-visual/spatial synaesthete will see shapes, movement and colours when they detect certain smells.While scientists have known about synaesthesia for 200 years, only recently have researchers – across the fields of psychology, neuroscience and psycholinguistics – been able to focus their attentions on what effect the condition has on synaesthetes&apos; broader cognitive function and, crucially, what synaesthesia may be able to do for the non-synaesthete population.&quot;There&apos;s definitely been a shift in the time I&apos;ve been a synaesthesia researcher,&quot; says Dr <Person gate:gateId="2971" firstName="Julia" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" surname="Simner" kind="fullName" rule="PersonFull" gate:matches="2948;2966;2967">Julia Simner</Person>, co-editor of The <Location gate:gateId="2972" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Oxford</Location> Handbook of Synesthesia, who runs the synaesthesia and sensory integration laboratory at the <Organization gate:gateId="2973" orgType="university" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">University of Edinburgh</Organization>.Her team has recently been awarded a €1.3m grant by the <Organization gate:gateId="2974" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">European Research Council</Organization> to develop the first test to identify the condition in children. And, in parallel, <Person gate:gateId="2981" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="2948;2966;2967" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Simner</Person> and her team are working with researchers at the <Organization gate:gateId="2975" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Max Planck Institute</Organization> for Psycholinguistics in <Location gate:gateId="2976" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="city" kind="locName">Nijmegen</Location> in <Location gate:gateId="2977" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" kind="locName">the Netherlands</Location> on a study to try to identify the genes implicated in synaesthesia, which often runs in families&quot;Before when I gave talks about synaesthesia, 96% of the audience would not believe it and the others – the synaesthetes – would think it was just obvious. Now it&apos;s shifted away from the burden of proof and we are free to explore the questions scientists really want to ask,&quot; <Person gate:gateId="2980" rule="PersonSays" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="female" gate:matches="2948;2966;2967">Simner</Person> says, noting that advances in brain imaging had provided better evidence of the existence of synaesthesia.&quot;One of the streams of the latest research is to look at how synaesthesia affects development in a child. How much of your cognitive profile, what you&apos;re good at and what you&apos;re not good at, is affected by synaesthesia? We are looking for benefits and deficits as well as whether we can use multisensory effects to help learning in the average child,&quot; she says.Dr <Person gate:gateId="2978" firstName="Michael" rule="PersonFull" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Banissy" kind="fullName">Michael Banissy</Person>, senior lecturer in psychology at <Organization gate:gateId="2979" orgType="university" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Goldsmiths, University of London</Organization>, agrees that understanding how the condition develops in children will be a focus of future research and key to a broader comprehension of synaesthesia
