  The value of colombian exports other than
  coffee rose 55 pct in january compared with the same period
  last year, apparently setting a trend for the trade balance in
  1987, government statistics institute figures show.
      They amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln
  dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.
      The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
  with a 56 mln dlr surplus in january 1986.
      The national planning department forecast that in 1987
  coffee, <Location gate:gateId="407" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="396;403">colombia</Location>&apos;s traditional major export, will account for
  only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.
