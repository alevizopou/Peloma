  The outcome of today&apos;s <Organization gate:gateId="399" orgType="other" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="385;387;388;391">European Community</Organization>
  (<Organization gate:gateId="400" orgType="other" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="385;387;388;391">EC</Organization>) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after
  last week&apos;s substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest
  ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100
  kilos, traders said.
      Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be
  smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view
  on the likely restitution. Last week, the <Organization gate:gateId="401" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="385;387;388;391">European Commission</Organization>
  accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators
  protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining
  factor in today&apos;s result, they added.
