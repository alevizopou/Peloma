  <Location gate:gateId="666" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="644;645;648;652">Colombia</Location>&apos;s coffee export registrations
  remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new
  marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,
  Gilberto <Person gate:gateId="669" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="661;662;663" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Arango</Person>, president of the private exporters&apos;
  association said.
      &quot;The philosophy of the new policy is not to close
  registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed,&quot; he told
  <Organization gate:gateId="667" orgType="company" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">Reuters</Organization>.
      On March 13, <Location gate:gateId="670" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="644;645;648;652">Colombia</Location> opened registrations for April and
  May for an unlimited amount.
      Without giving breakdowns, <Person gate:gateId="665" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="661;662;663">Arango</Person> said private exporters
  had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,
  or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the
  average in recent years.
      He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national
  coffee growers&apos; federation at about the same, meaning a total
  of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by
  <Location gate:gateId="671" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="644;645;648;652">Colombia</Location>.
      &quot;The only change that could happen is, because of the
  volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations
  would be for June shipment, etc&quot; <Person gate:gateId="668" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="661;662;663">Arango</Person> said.
