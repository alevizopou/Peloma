  <Location gate:gateId="1023" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="976;978;991;997">Ivory Coast</Location> rainfall this season has

      The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
  conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
  Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
  there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
      Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
  in <Location gate:gateId="1025" locType="pre" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">northern savannah</Location> regions, where the cotton crop has
  especially benefitted from the dry weather, <Person gate:gateId="1024" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="1015;1016;1017;1018">Fraternite Matin</Person>
  said.
      Agriculture Minister <Person gate:gateId="1026" firstName="Denis" rule="PersonFullDoubleBarrelled" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Kanon" kind="fullName">Denis Bra Kanon</Person> said earlier this
  month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
  compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
      <Person gate:gateId="1027" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="1015;1016;1017;1018">Fraternite Matin</Person> said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
  had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
  need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
  been affected in some regions, it added.

  the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year&apos;s
  4.33 mln bag harvest.
      Ivorian officials have only described this year&apos;s coffee
  crop as &quot;normal.&quot;
