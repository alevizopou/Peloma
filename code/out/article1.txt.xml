Sitting in a small, computer-lined room trying to remember a succession of different-coloured words scrolling past on a screen doesn&amp;apos;t sound like the cutting edge of scientific research. However, academics at the &lt;Organization gate:gateId=&quot;4891&quot; orgType=&quot;university&quot; rule=&quot;GazOrganization&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;OrgFinal&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4825;4841&quot;&gt;<Organization gate:gateId="14344" orgType="university" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="14132;14154">University of East London</Organization>&lt;/Organization&gt; are using word tests to assess the impact synaesthesia can have on memory – and the potential it might have to &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4892&quot; rule=&quot;GazPersonFirst&quot; firstName=&quot;<Person gate:gateId="14345" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ward" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="14133;14134;14159" kind="firstName">ward</Person>&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;PersonFinal&quot; gender=&quot;male&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4826;4844&quot; kind=&quot;firstName&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14346" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="ward" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="14133;14134;14159" kind="firstName">ward</Person>&lt;/Person&gt; off the decline in cognitive function that can affect the elderly. Synaesthesia, the neurological condition that causes a blending of the senses – colours can be connected to letters and numbers, smells and tastes to music or touch to vision – has long been linked to creativity: famous synaesthetes include Sibelius and more recently Pharrell Williams and &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4893&quot; firstName=&quot;Lady&quot; rule=&quot;GazPerson&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;PersonFinal&quot; gender=&quot;female&quot; surname=&quot;<Person gate:gateId="14341" rule="Unknown" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="female" gate:matches="14135;14307" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Gaga</Person>&quot; kind=&quot;fullName&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14347" firstName="Lady" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" surname="Gaga" kind="fullName" rule="GazPerson" gate:matches="14135;14307">Lady Gaga</Person>&lt;/Person&gt;.But among the wider population it has remained a mysterious condition, although it is known to affect at least 4.4% of adults across its many forms.For instance, a grapheme-colour synaesthete might &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; the days of the week, letters and numbers as particular colours; a lexical-gustatory synaesthete will experience a particular taste in their mouth when they hear a given word; and an odour-visual/spatial synaesthete will see shapes, movement and colours when they detect certain smells.While scientists have known about synaesthesia for 200 years, only recently have researchers – across the fields of psychology, neuroscience and psycholinguistics – been able to focus their attentions on what effect the condition has on synaesthetes&amp;apos; broader cognitive function and, crucially, what synaesthesia may be able to do for the non-synaesthete population.&amp;quot;There&amp;apos;s definitely been a shift in the time I&amp;apos;ve been a synaesthesia researcher,&amp;quot; says &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4894&quot; firstName=&quot;<Person gate:gateId="14348" firstName="Julia" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" matchedWithLonger="true" kind="firstName" rule="GazPersonFirst" gate:matches="14136;14137;14296;14300;14308;14309">Julia</Person>&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;PersonFinal&quot; gender=&quot;unknown&quot; surname=&quot;<Person gate:gateId="14342" rule="Unknown" matchedWithLonger="true" gender="female" gate:matches="14136;14137;14296;14300;14308;14309" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Simner</Person>&quot; kind=&quot;personName&quot; rule=&quot;PersonTitleGenderUnknown&quot; title=&quot;Dr&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4828;4871;4873;4879&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14349" firstName="Julia" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="female" surname="Simner" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitleGenderUnknown" title="Dr" gate:matches="14136;14137;14296;14300;14308;14309">Dr Julia Simner</Person>&lt;/Person&gt;, co-editor of The &lt;Location gate:gateId=&quot;4895&quot; locType=&quot;city&quot; rule=&quot;Location1&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;LocFinal&quot;&gt;<Location gate:gateId="14350" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Oxford</Location>&lt;/Location&gt; Handbook of Synesthesia, who runs the synaesthesia and sensory integration laboratory at the &lt;Organization gate:gateId=&quot;4896&quot; orgType=&quot;university&quot; rule=&quot;GazOrganization&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;OrgFinal&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4830;4838&quot;&gt;<Organization gate:gateId="14351" orgType="university" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="14139;14149">University of Edinburgh</Organization>&lt;/Organization&gt;.Her team has recently been awarded a €1.3m grant by the &lt;Organization gate:gateId=&quot;4897&quot; orgType=&quot;unknown&quot; rule=&quot;TheOrgXBase&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;OrgFinal&quot;&gt;<Organization gate:gateId="14352" orgType="unknown" rule="OrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">European Research Council</Organization>&lt;/Organization&gt; to develop the first test to identify the condition in children.

Now it is basically accepted that synaesthetes perceive the world differently and we are asking how it relates to other cognitive functions,&amp;quot; he says.That may lead to interesting findings about cognitive function that can be applied to the general population. &amp;quot;People are different,&amp;quot; says &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4882&quot; matchedWithLonger=&quot;true&quot; rule=&quot;SaysPerson&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4837;4872;4874;4880&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14333" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14147;14148;14298;14299;14301;14302" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Rothen</Person>&lt;/Person&gt;, &amp;quot;and we need to consider those individual differences. Synaesthesia is a neat way to study differences in perception and their relation to higher cognitive functions such as memory and language processing.&amp;quot;But while scientists are interested in the differences between the brains of synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, research is also being carried out into how the two can be brought closer together.&amp;quot;One thing we have found is that synaesthetes are not a different class of people – they simply have more explicit experiences,&amp;quot; &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4883&quot; matchedWithLonger=&quot;true&quot; rule=&quot;PersonSays&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4828;4871;4873;4879&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14334" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14136;14137;14296;14300;14308;14309" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Simner</Person>&lt;/Person&gt; says. &amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s a more extreme manifestation of what all of us experience. Asking non-synaesthetes, &amp;apos;What colour is A?&amp;apos; is a baffling question, but synaesthetes have a window into perception we all share; when pressed for an answer, we all pair more common letters with brighter colours or higher pitched notes with lighter colours.&amp;quot; Studies such as one carried out by &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4905&quot; firstName=&quot;<Location gate:gateId="14316" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Clare</Location>&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;PersonFinal&quot; gender=&quot;male&quot; surname=&quot;<Person gate:gateId="14317" firstName="Jonas" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" matchedWithLonger="true" kind="firstName" rule="GazPersonFirst" gate:matches="14152;14153;14155;14156;14157;14158;14160;14161;14163;14164">Jonas</Person>&quot; kind=&quot;personName&quot; rule=&quot;PersonTitleGenderUnknown&quot; title=&quot;Dr&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4840;4842;4843;4845;4847&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14318" firstName="Clare" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" surname="Jonas" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitleGenderUnknown" title="Dr" gate:matches="14152;14153;14155;14156;14157;14158;14160;14161;14163;14164">Dr Clare Jonas</Person>&lt;/Person&gt; at the &lt;Organization gate:gateId=&quot;4906&quot; orgType=&quot;university&quot; rule=&quot;GazOrganization&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;OrgFinal&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4825;4841&quot;&gt;<Organization gate:gateId="14319" orgType="university" rule="GazOrganization" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="14132;14154">University of East London</Organization>&lt;/Organization&gt; aim to take that link between synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes one step further, by training non-synaesthetes to have the same associations that synaesthetes have – and then assessing the impact their newly acquired synaesthesia has on their memory and cognitive function. That&amp;apos;s where the word test comes in. After training a small group of young adults to associate certain letters with certain colours, the researchers use the test to find out if they remember words more easily if they are coloured to match their synaesthetic training.So far, the results seem to suggest that they do. The researchers assessed participants&amp;apos; memory before and after the synaesthesia training, by getting them to look at a list of words in which there was an odd one out – either a word written in the colour they had been taught to associate with it or a word whose meaning did not fit in with the rest of the list. &amp;quot;Using predictions based on what real synaesthetes do, there seemed to be a tendency towards the trained synaesthetes starting to behave like synaesthetes – having a better memory for things involved in their synaesthesia; if confirmed, that would be a good sign,&amp;quot; &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4907&quot; firstName=&quot;<Person gate:gateId="14320" firstName="Jonas" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" matchedWithLonger="true" kind="firstName" rule="GazPersonFirst" gate:matches="14152;14153;14155;14156;14157;14158;14160;14161;14163;14164">Jonas</Person>&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;PersonFinal&quot; gender=&quot;male&quot; matchedWithLonger=&quot;true&quot; kind=&quot;firstName&quot; rule=&quot;GazPersonFirst&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4840;4842;4843;4845;4847&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14321" firstName="Jonas" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" matchedWithLonger="true" kind="firstName" rule="GazPersonFirst" gate:matches="14152;14153;14155;14156;14157;14158;14160;14161;14163;14164">Jonas</Person>&lt;/Person&gt; says.Synaesthetes tend to remember the stand-out word more easily if it is in the correct colour, while they perform worse on tests in which words stand out because of their meaning – a list containing the words colander, whisk, spatula and ballet, for example.Researchers find that interesting in itself because going beyond the surface to the meaning of the word is normally the key to improving performance in these kinds of memory games.

As long as there is sufficient cognitive ability people could perhaps start doing the training in their 50s as a way of topping up their memory skills.&amp;quot;One obstacle for the moment is the dull and time-consuming memorising of letters and their matching colours that the training demands. But researchers in &lt;Location gate:gateId=&quot;4911&quot; rule=&quot;InLoc1&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;LocFinal&quot; locType=&quot;country&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4834;4846&quot; kind=&quot;locName&quot;&gt;<Location gate:gateId="14327" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="14143;14162">the Netherlands</Location>&lt;/Location&gt; may have found a way round that, developing a browser plug-in that automatically colours certain letters as part of a wider study into whether synaesthesia could be learned. &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4890&quot; rule=&quot;Unknown&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4837;4872;4874;4880&quot; NMRule=&quot;Unknown&quot; kind=&quot;PN&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14335" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14147;14148;14298;14299;14301;14302" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Rothen</Person>&lt;/Person&gt;, who has been carrying out studies involving training non-synaesthetes to behave like synaesthetes, also thinks synaesthesia research could have implications for the elderly, a potentially important breakthrough for an ageing population. &amp;quot;People are only just beginning to study synaesthesia over the lifespan. There is a theory that it may be protective in the case of age-related cognitive decline. There is evidence that grapheme-colour synaesthesia in particular leads to enhanced memory functions and we wondered if non-synaesthetes could be trained to have the same associations as synaesthetes and if it would lead to the same enhancements.&amp;quot;However, while the studies demonstrate that it is possible to train non-synaesthetes to make the automatic link experienced synaesthetes – that C is yellow, for example – it is not yet clear whether the phenomenological experience, or the way synaesthetes will &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; either in their mind&amp;apos;s eye or projected on to the page that C is yellow, can be induced. &amp;quot;We know that synaesthesia comes with benefits and that certain aspects can be trained. What we don&amp;apos;t know is which aspect of the synaesthesia leads to the advantage – the automatic association or the phenomenological experience,&amp;quot; &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4884&quot; matchedWithLonger=&quot;true&quot; rule=&quot;PersonSays&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4837;4872;4874;4880&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14336" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14147;14148;14298;14299;14301;14302" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Rothen</Person>&lt;/Person&gt; says. But he adds: &amp;quot;We have some hints that synaesthesia leads to performance enhancements with regards to memory performance and visual mental imagery.&amp;quot; &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4887&quot; rule=&quot;Unknown&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4835;4875;4876;4877;4878&quot; NMRule=&quot;Unknown&quot; kind=&quot;PN&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14337" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14144;14145;14297;14303;14304;14305;14306" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Banissy</Person>&lt;/Person&gt;&amp;apos;s particular area of focus is social neuroscience and he explains that research into mirror-touch synaesthesia, in which, for example, just seeing someone else&amp;apos;s face being touched sparks the sensation in the synaesthete that their own face is being touched, could reveal interesting findings about what causes synaesthetic reactions, as well as possible ways to harness those for non-synaesthetes. &amp;quot;Using brain imaging, we have shown that mirror-touch synaesthetes recruit similar parts of the brain as we all do when we observe others being touched,&amp;quot; says &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4885&quot; matchedWithLonger=&quot;true&quot; rule=&quot;SaysPerson&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4835;4875;4876;4877;4878&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14338" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14144;14145;14297;14303;14304;14305;14306" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Banissy</Person>&lt;/Person&gt;. &amp;quot;However, mirror-touch synaesthetes hyper-activate this system to the extent that they literally experience what they see. In this regard, mirror-touch synaesthesia is interesting because it provides a unique window into how we represent other people&amp;apos;s experience.&amp;quot; &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4888&quot; rule=&quot;Unknown&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4835;4875;4876;4877;4878&quot; NMRule=&quot;Unknown&quot; kind=&quot;PN&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14339" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14144;14145;14297;14303;14304;14305;14306" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Banissy</Person>&lt;/Person&gt; is interested in the way synaesthesia develops in the brain and in particular how so-called hyper-excitability in areas of the brain such as the somatosensory cortex could cause synaesthesia. &amp;quot;In synaesthetes, the balance between excitability and inhibition is unusual. So the question is, can we generate synaesthesia in non-synaesthetes by manipulating that balance?&amp;quot;Scientists know that balance can be tipped by hypnosis or drugs: LSD, for example, produces a synaesthesia-like experience but more research is needed into other ways to change it.&amp;quot;Using brain imaging, we can identify which areas are related to synaesthesia, but we can&amp;apos;t tell what is causal. To do this, we need to modulate the relevant part of the brain and see what effect this has on generating synaesthetic experiences,&amp;quot; &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4886&quot; matchedWithLonger=&quot;true&quot; rule=&quot;PersonSays&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4835;4875;4876;4877;4878&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14340" rule="Unknown" gate:matches="14144;14145;14297;14303;14304;14305;14306" NMRule="Unknown" kind="PN">Banissy</Person>&lt;/Person&gt; says. While the researchers are coming from different scientific backgrounds and investigating the condition from different angles, a common thread is exploring how synaesthetic techniques can be applied more broadly.&amp;quot;Synaesthesia is obviously useful to synaesthetes in some ways,&amp;quot; says &lt;Person gate:gateId=&quot;4912&quot; firstName=&quot;<Person gate:gateId="14328" firstName="Jonas" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" matchedWithLonger="true" kind="firstName" rule="GazPersonFirst" gate:matches="14152;14153;14155;14156;14157;14158;14160;14161;14163;14164">Jonas</Person>&quot; ruleFinal=&quot;PersonFinal&quot; gender=&quot;male&quot; matchedWithLonger=&quot;true&quot; kind=&quot;firstName&quot; rule=&quot;GazPersonFirst&quot; gate:matches=&quot;4840;4842;4843;4845;4847&quot;&gt;<Person gate:gateId="14329" firstName="Jonas" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" matchedWithLonger="true" kind="firstName" rule="GazPersonFirst" gate:matches="14152;14153;14155;14156;14157;14158;14160;14161;14163;14164">Jonas</Person>&lt;/Person&gt;. &amp;quot;It would be really nice if we could find a way to give the useful bits of synaesthesia to people who don&amp;apos;t have it.
