President Trump will make America smaller. He may not be thinking in these terms. But as he barrels ahead with his promise to restrict immigration — barring people from some Muslim-majority countries, limiting work visas, expelling millions who are here illegally — the president might want to ponder how this fits the theme of making America “great again.” For his plan, at the scale he promises, would shrink the American economy and impoverish the world. If greatness is what he pursues, a straightforward way to bulk up the economy — not to say bolster global growth — would be to allow many more immigrants in. Consider the report on immigration released last fall by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. It concluded that immigration to the United States between 1990 and 2010, both legal and illegal, produced net benefits worth $50 billion a year to the native population. This might seem insignificant in an $18 trillion economy. But it packs more than meets the eye. It is more than the government’s estimate of what the country would have gained from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the grand deal with 11 other countries around the Pacific Rim negotiated over eight years by the Obama administration but abandoned by Mr. Trump. The number does not consider many likely benefits from immigration. For instance, immigrants are younger. They are slowing the aging of the work force. Low-skilled immigrants may increase the labor supply of high-skilled natives, say, by providing cheap child care and releasing mothers to work. High-skilled immigrants contribute disproportionately to innovation, seeking patents at a higher rate than natives. Notably, the number does not include the economic rewards that accrue to the immigrants themselves: 26 million foreigners in the American labor market added some $2 trillion to the American economy last year, according to the National Academies report. Mr. Trump has not shown much interest in the well-being of people born outside the nation’s borders. But even in the narrowest, most parochial sense, their income contributes to the nation’s greatness. As Mr. Trump maneuvers to face off with China, he might stop to consider what the rivalry would look like if the United States were $2 trillion smaller. This is a challenge for not only Mr. Trump but also the entire crop of xenophobic, nativist leaders emerging all over the industrialized world: Few things would make the economic pie bigger than free flows of people from poor countries to rich ones. Immigration — not trade liberalization or the elimination of barriers to capital flows — offers the best shot at raising the incomes of the poor and increasing economic output around the world. It’s not even surprising. Research by Michael A. Clemens of the Center for Global Development, Lant Pritchett of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and Claudio E. Montenegro of the World Bank found that a 35-year-old urban man born and educated in Peru, who had nine years of school and worked in the formal Peruvian economy, made an average of $452 a month. A Peruvian with these exact characteristics working in the United States, by contrast, made $1,714 a month. A typical Pakistani worker who moved from Karachi to Los Angeles would at a stroke make more than six times as much. A Yemeni would raise his earnings 14.5 times. And this would not even require retraining. Someone flipping murtabak on the streets of Sana would earn 15.5 times as much simply by coming to New York to flip burgers at McDonald’s. These vast wage gaps underscore the critical value of place: The physical and social infrastructure of the United States automatically lifts the productivity of workers from the most backward countries. But the income differential also highlights how tough barriers against immigration truly are. If workers could move seamlessly across borders, wages of similar workers would tend to converge. The wage gap is a measure of the barriers that remain: An hour of work by a Pakistani in New York costs 6.5 times what an hour of the same Pakistani’s time costs in Karachi. By contrast, the product of that Pakistani’s work back home could enter the United States paying a tariff, on average, of only 3.5 percent. If barriers to immigration are orders of magnitude steeper than barriers to trade, removing such obstacles — allowing workers to flock to where they are most productive — would provide a much bigger impetus to the economy than any effort at trade liberalization. “If trade deals were strictly about efficiency and growing the size of the overall economic pie,” argues Dani Rodrik of the Kennedy School, “trade negotiators would drop everything else on their agenda and spend their whole time trying to strike a bargain whereby workers from poor countries could participate in the labor markets of the rich countries.” Indeed, some economists have estimated that allowing free cross-border movement of labor could more than double the world’s gross domestic product. As Mr. Clemens at the Center for Global Development put it, maintaining harsh barriers on immigration amounts to leaving “trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk.” Immigration carries costs, of course. It weighs on the wages of the workers who directly compete with the newcomers. And yet they are small compared with the vast potential for gains. Even some of the most pessimistic analysts find relatively modest effects on domestic workers. George Borjas of Harvard, by no means a supporter of liberal immigration, has estimated that the newcomers who arrived in the United States from 1990 to 2010 reduced the wages of American-born high school dropouts over the long term by 3.1 percent — or some $900 a year. This number has been criticized as far too high by other economists for relying on implausible assumptions. But even if it were correct, it would not seem like a big deal. To help the 10 million high school dropouts in the labor force, there are more effective tools (like raising the earned-income tax credit) than immigration law. That is not to say America’s borders should be opened to all comers. Whatever the economic benefits, immigration remains a touchy topic everywhere. A poll by the Pew Research Center in 2010 found that three in four Americans favored tighter restrictions on immigration. So did 66 percent of Germans, 77 percent of Venezuelans and 89 percent of South Africans. And who knows what would happen to productivity and wages, to politics and social cohesion, if immigration took off on an unprecedented scale? A third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa say they would like to migrate permanently. So would a fifth of Latin Americans and one in 10 South and East Asians, according to a Gallup World poll from 2010. About a quarter of these potential migrants — 145 million adults — would like to live in the United States. But that still leaves space for moderate liberalization. As Mr. Clemens argues, if only 5 percent of the population of poor countries were allowed to migrate to richer ones, the global gains would exceed those made from removing all policy barriers to merchandise trade and capital flows. So how about an expanded guest-worker program? It could grant visas for, say, a fixed five-year period with no path to citizenship, and deploy both carrots and sticks to ensure that workers returned home. This would help spread the benefits of migration around, and also help the nations sending the migrants, who would benefit from their experience and capital when they returned home. Considering the dim prospects for global growth, the economy could use the help. Such an about-face might prove politically costly — not to say embarrassing for Mr. Trump. But unlike many of his ideas, it would help keep America great.***********************************************************************British workers face “cut-rate, bottom-of-the-league protections” after Brexit, with more zero-hours contracts and fewer guarantees over holiday and equal pay, the TUC has warned, as it publishes a damning report highlighting the soaring number of insecure jobs in the UK. The number of workers without guaranteed hours or basic employment rights has risen by more than 660,000 in the past five years, the study found. Labour said an "explosion" of insecure jobs was likely unless fundamental workers’ rights were protected.  And the dire situation many employees now face is predicted to intensify once the Government drags the UK out of the EU. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said insecure work had become “the new normal for far too many people” and the problem was “getting worse” as Theresa May pushes ahead with a hard Brexit. “If the Government rushes to the bottom on employment rights after Brexit, we could see even more of these dodgy contracts,” she told The Independent. “People in Britain deserve better than cut-rate, bottom-of-the-league protections at work.” More than three million people now work in insecure jobs, representing one in 10 employees in the UK. That is up from 2.4 million in 2011. TUC research showed the 27 per cent rise in insecure jobs was being driven by traditional industries, such as teachers, carers and the service sector. It suggests those on lower salaries could be hit hardest by the shifting jobs market. Those employed in newer, technology sectors, for example, were better insulated from the changes in employment conditions, the federation of trade unions found. Shadow business minister Jack Dromey questioned Ms May's sincerity in protecting workers' rights. "Under the Tories, Brexit risks making a bad situation worse," he said. "I simply do not believe assurances that Theresa May will protect workers’ rights that are currently guaranteed by membership of the European Union. “Labour will fight to make sure that the Tories do not use Brexit to rob British workers of their rights. Britain must not become an offshore island with British workers the poor relation to their European neighbours.” Labour backbencher Melanie Onn, who tabled a series of amendments to the Government’s bill and introduced her own bill to safeguard workers’ rights derived from EU legislation, said the Tories had a mandate to leave the EU but not to "downgrade the rights of workers". “There is a great risk that without fundamental workers’ rights, which come from the EU, we will see an explosion of temporary, insecure jobs and zero hour contracts," she told The Independent. The TUC report reveals workers are increasingly faced with zero-hours contracts – where they have no guaranteed minimum income each month and the hours they work fluctuate – and fewer protections for casual, agency or temporary staff over 'benefits' such as sick pay. Jobs in the arts and entertainment sector are most likely to face insecurity, a league table of industries shows, with two-thirds of actors and artists judged to be in unprotected employment. This is followed by those in other service industries, such as hairdressers, fitness instructors and cleaners, as well as taxi, train and lorry drivers, where around a third of jobs are classified as insecure. The EU acts as a safeguard against any government overriding basic rights - from limits on working hours to guaranteed maternity rights. Ms May has promised that existing rights will be guaranteed and the Great Repeal bill will convert all EU laws, including the ones relating to employment rights, to UK law. But unions and MPs fear that the UK could fall behind the rest of the EU after Brexit, as Brussels enacts greater protections while Westminster enforces the status quo. Ms O'Grady added: "Insecurity at work is becoming the new normal for too many workers. “It's happening across new and old industries, with workers forced onto shady contracts, whether they're Uber drivers, bar staff or teaching assistants. "People need jobs they can live on and build a life around, but if you don't how much work you will have from one day to the next, making ends meet is a nightmare. "The rules that protect workers need to be dragged into the 21st Century." Despite Ms May’s pledge to protect rights, threats from the Government to slash corporation tax if they don’t get a good deal from Brussels will raise fears that workers’ rights could be ripped up in an effort to retain businesses in Britain. At the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel cautioned Downing Street against slashing levies on firms operating in the UK, saying Germany would not enter a race to the bottom on regulations and taxes. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis also warned about employment rights being ripped up. "If the Prime Minister pushes ahead with a hard Brexit things are set to get a whole lot worse," he said. "Then we're likely to see employment rights being scrapped right, left and centre. And with European citizens making up a significant proportion of the social care workforce, any lingering uncertainty over their right to remain could soon lead to severe shortages of experienced care workers." A spokesman for the union Unite added: “A lot will depend on what happens after the Great Repeal bill and whether Theresa May sticks to her word on workers’ rights not being diluted once we’ve withdrawn from the EU. “Either way there are some things the Government can do here and now such as beefing enforcement to crack down on rogue bosses, Government ministers supporting trade unions in addition to following the lead of New Zealand where a conservative government banned zero hours contacts.”***********************************************************************Angela Merkel’s CDU political party has fallen into second place behind Germany’s centre-left opposition for the first time in a decade, according to a new poll. The survey, carried out by pollsters INSA for Germany’s Bild newspaper, found Ms Merkel’s Christian democrats on 30 per cent, down three from the previous poll. The German Social Democratic Party (SPD), which has trailed Ms Merkel’s party in the polls for years, was meanwhile up four points to 31 per cent – putting it just slightly ahead. A German election polling average maintained by German newspaper Der Spiegel has not had the SPD ahead on average since late 2006. Though only the findings of a single poll, the latest results appear to be a symbolic watershed moment in Germany politics, which Ms Merkel has dominated for over a decade. The findings of a significant boost for the SPD are also corroborated by another poll conducted by Emnid for Bild am Sonntag. That survey recorded a six-point jump for the SPD, reportedly the biggest ever for the party in a single poll by that firm. The shifting electoral landscape comes just months ahead of crunch German Federal elections in September of this year – raising the possibility that Ms Merkel could be ousted as Chancellor after six months of Brexit negotiations. The boost to the SPD’s fortunes appears to have been prompted by the appointment of Martin Schulz, former European Parliament President, to the party’s leadership. Mr Schulz has publicly presented a more hard-line approach again Britain and Brexit than Ms Merkel, having accused top Tories of having left “rubble behind them in a bid to fuel their personal ambitions”. He has also said that Brussels would need to “defend the interests of its citizens, just as the UK will do”. The Chancellor Ms Merkel has survived in part by adopting the policies of her opponents whenever they appear to be on the verge of finding a chink in her armour – posing the possibility that she might adopt Mr Schulz’s more hardline anti-Brexit approach. The German federal elections come five months after France picks its new President. The final round of that contest is likely to be between a centre-right candidate and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.***********************************************************************Vladimir Putin has signed into law a controversial amendment that decriminalises domestic violence. The amendment, which sailed through both houses of Russian parliament before Tuesday’s presidential signing, has elicited anger from critics who say that it sends the wrong message in a country where one woman dies every 40 minutes from domestic abuse. From now on, beatings of spouses or children that result in bruising or bleeding but not broken bones are punishable by 15 days in prison or a fine, if they do not happen more than once a year. Previously, they carried a maximum jail sentence of two years. Alena Popova, an activist who has campaigned against the law, said it would be fine to pass the amendments if a draft law specifically aimed at tackling domestic violence was passed at the same time. But that law, which provides for restraining orders and other safeguards in domestic abuse cases, is stalled in parliament and is not expected to be passed. “Passing these amendments and not passing the other law is another sign that our society refuses to take this problem seriously,” she said. Defenders of the law say it closes a nonsensical loophole by which violent acts committed by family members are punished more harshly than those committed by strangers. “The question is not whether it’s OK to hit or not. Of course it isn’t. The question is how to punish people and what you should punish them for,” said Olga Batalina, one of the MPs who drafted the law. Others claim the law is about protecting Russian traditions according to which the family is sacred. Priest Dmitry Smirnov, head of the Russian Orthodox Patriarchy’s commission on family matters, said on a television programme that the idea the state should be able to poke its nose into family affairs was a western imposition on Russia. “Some of the things happening in northern Europe now are such that even Hitler couldn’t have dreamed them up,” he said. Some of the mainstream discussion around gender and domestic violence in Russia can be shocking. An article last week in the science section of the popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda cheerfully told readers about an “advantage” of wife-beating. It said: “Recent scientific studies show the wives of angry men have a reason to be proud of their bruises. Biologists say that beaten-up women have a valuable advantage: they more often give birth to boys!” Popova said that during her one-woman protest outside parliament, various people had insulted her. Some had claimed she was paid to protest by western governments, while others told her that some women simply deserved to be beaten, she said. Discussion of the bill in parliament coincided with the women’s marches in Washington DC and around the world in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, provoking a broader discussion about the problem of domestic violence and the role of women in contemporary Russia. In Moscow, there was no official march organised, partly due to lack of interest, and partly because of the difficulty in gaining permission to march from the Russian authorities. A planned demonstration against the domestic violence amendments has been repeatedly stymied by authorities. Margarita Grigoryan, a Moscow-born businesswoman who grew up in London but moved backed recently to open a business, organised a short walk around the Russian capital. About 15 people took part. “I was depressed that someone so overtly misogynistic could get into the White House, and especially being in this country, I felt I wanted to protest, but there was nothing at all organised here,” she said. Political analyst Maria Lipman said the situation around gender roles in Russia was paradoxical. “The Soviet period saw gender equality from above, so some of the rights that women in the west fought for were granted or even imposed on Russian women,” said Lipman. “This meant that the way gender relations developed was different, and Russian women never had to fight for their rights. Now on the one hand we have huge problems with unequal pay, with no women in politics, with domestic abuse, but on the other hand there are more top [female] editors of leading media outlets than in the United States, and there are many top women bankers, for example.” Nearly 300,000 people signed a petition organised by Popova to protest against the amendments, and a recent online campaign also attempted to bring the domestic abuse problem out into the open. Using the hashtag #Iamnotscaredtospeak, thousands of Russian women shared their stories of sexual harassment, violence and rape on social media. The tidal wave of terrible stories shocked many Russians, and prompted something of a discussion. But there is a major disparity between the attitudes of Russia’s urban middle class, and the situation in the regions. “There is a big constituency in Russia for whom interference in family affairs can be portrayed as another issue in which the west is trying to impose its views on Russia,” said Lipman. Maria Alekhina, of the Pussy Riot protest group, said the legal amendments were a red herring, and it was Russian society and attitudes as a whole that needed to change to help alleviate the domestic abuse situation. Alekhina spent nearly two years in prison for carrying out a “punk prayer” in Moscow’s main cathedral in 2012, and said between a quarter and a third of the women she met in jail were there for attacking abusive husbands: “They were usually women who had been beaten up for years, and there was nowhere for them to go. We have no social help and no psychological help available. So one day they just pick up a knife and kill their husbands.”***********************************************************************John Bercow spoke for Britain. If the government wishes to grant a state visit to the bigoted megalomaniac who currently inhabits the White House, that is technically its right. But the speaker has the right to intervene on who gets to address parliament. To coin a phrase, Speaker Bercow took back control. Last year’s victors in the EU referendum promised parliamentary sovereignty: they cannot object when it is now exercised. Given Bercow’s commendable efforts to combat sexism and racism in politics, it would have been hypocritical not to speak out. It is Bercow’s reasoning – that Donald Trump’s sexism, racism and attacks on the independence of the judiciary disqualify him from a parliamentary visit – that have led some to criticise the speaker for abandoning political neutrality. There is an important argument to be had here. Soon after Trump’s election, a senior broadcast news producer told me of his fears about the way in which the new president would be normalised. It included muddying the water on, say, what actually constitutes racism or sexism. Rather than reporting the president’s interventions as being racist or sexist, his comments would become merely “controversial”. And as such, the most powerful man on Earth would help send the fights against discrimination of various hues hurtling back decades, because it would become harder to identify it, let alone call it out. Trump has spoken about women in the most derogatory terms possible, has smeared Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, demanded a blanket ban on Muslims, and appointed as chief strategist the former editor of a far-right website. His sexism and racism are objective facts. The sky is blue, the Earth is round, Trump is a racist and a sexist. When we start arguing that his racism and sexism are open to debate, that to label him as such is to compromise objectivity, we strip both words of their meaning. This is already happening. The emboldened bigots of the western world believe they can speak and act with impunity, and nobody can challenge them on it. This must stop. If Theresa May believed that her attempts to turn Britain into a client state of Trump’s America would be smooth, she should have been less naive. The government is under pressure, it is on the defensive: exactly the moment to up the ante. On Thursday, the new Stop Trump coalition has its first open activists’ meeting to plan coming actions. When members of parliament debate Trump’s state visit – an honour some US presidents have never received – on 20 February, they will hear the voices of thousands of protesters outside. The British government is invaluable to Trump: May helps to normalise and legitimise him. That the speaker of the House of Commons called out Trump for what he is underlines that this is no normal president. The government didn’t have to humiliate Britain by trying to make this country Trump’s lapdog. It chose to, and now it is facing the consequences.***********************************************************************The White House has distributed a list of 78 terrorist attacks to support Donald Trump’s claim that the media is failing to properly report them. But the list includes many atrocities that received blanket western media coverage including the Paris Bataclan attacks, the Nice truck killings and the San Bernardino shootings. Many others including the Sydney siege and Germany’s Christmas market attack received wide international coverage. The list also includes multiple errors and spelling mistakes, including “San Bernadino”, and excludes numerous terror attacks across the Middle East. The release comes after the US president told military leaders in Tampa, Florida, on Monday that there have been attacks all over Europe but “in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it”. He added: “They have their reasons, and you understand that,” but did not expand. Later the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, was asked about specific attacks that had not been reported, to which he replied: “We’ll provide a list later. There’s several instances … There’s a lot of instances that have occurred where I don’t think they’ve gotten the coverage it deserved.” That list, released to media outlets including the Guardian, included a “timeline” of domestic and international incidents from September 2014 to December 2016. Some, such as last year’s mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and the killing of 129 people in Paris in November 2015, received huge coverage. But officials claimed that “most” of the attacks were not adequately reported by western media outlets, CNN reported. The list hops from Afghanistan to Algeria to Australia but, without explanation, does not mention Israel, where incidents included a bus bombing in Jerusalem last year, carried out by a 19-year-old Palestinian, that injured 20 people. A December 2016 cut-off also excludes the Québec City mosque attack from the list, an attack Trump was publicly silent about, despite condemning on Twitter the Louvre attack in Paris several days later. The murder of British backpacker Mia Ayliffe-Chung in an Australian hostel last year was also included on the list, even though extremism had been ruled out as a motive by both police and the victim’s mother. In an open letter to Trump, Rosie Ayliffe accused Donald Trump of using “fake news” about her daughter’s death to further the “persecution of innocent people” by falsely claiming she was the victim of a terrorist attack. “My daughter’s death will not be used to further this insane persecution of innocent people,” she wrote. The document also includes spelling mistakes such as “attaker” instead of “attacker” and “Denmakr” instead of “Denmark”. There have been similar errors in official communications in recent days, including references to Theresa May as “Teresa” and a reference to Malcolm Turnbull as the “president” of Australia when it should be “prime minister”. The catalogue begins with an attack by Abdul Numan Haider, who wounded two police officers in a knife attack in Melbourne in September 2014. It ends with an atrocity involving Anis Amri, who drove a truck into a crowded market in Berlin last December, killing 12 and injuring 48. Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesperson, claimed that the list demonstrates how terrorist attacks are losing perceived news value because of their frequency. “The real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,” she said via email. “If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they’re happening so often – at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list – that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did. “This cannot be allowed to become the ‘new normal’, and the President, for one, is not going to be satisfied until the American people are much safer and more secure.” Earlier, Spicer told reporters travelling on Air Force One that Trump believes attacks are not “unreported” but “under-reported”. He said: “He felt members of the media don’t always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered.” But David Gergen, a political analyst and former adviser to four US presidents, condemned Trump’s remarks. “I think this is one of the most outrageous claims the president has made, among many, because it really says, basically, that the press is not doing its job because it has its own political agenda,” he told CNN. “It doesn’t want you to know the truth about how dangerous terrorism is. It doesn’t want to be out there, it’s just pulling a leftist agenda on you, which is clearly not true.” Gergen added: “He engages in these falsehoods without producing any serious evidence. The list includes San Bernardino, as if the press didn’t cover that sufficiently. It’s just astonishing and it’s beneath the dignity of the presidency and I think it tears at the fabric of what holds us together as a people when we can’t trust each other, we can’t trust the White House, and he’s telling us we can’t trust the press. This is the way democracies come unravelled.”***********************************************************************Angela Merkel seemingly had to explain the Geneva refugee convention to Donald Trump during a phone call. Mr Trump has signed an executive order to ban immigration from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 120 days and the German Chancellor said she “regrets” the move. The German Government also said it would examine the effect the ban would have on its citizens with dual citizenship and present the case to Mr Trump’s team. “The chancellor regrets the US government’s entry ban against refugees and the citizens of certain countries,” Ms Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.  “She is convinced that the necessary, decisive battle against terrorism does not justify a general suspicion against people of a certain origin or a certain religion. “The Geneva refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. All signatory states are obligated to do. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday,” he added. Mr Seibert also said that Ms Merkel "is convinced that even the necessary, resolute fight against terrorism doesn't justify putting people of a particular origin or particular faith under general suspicion," German news agency DPA reported. A summary of the 45-minute phone call between the two world leaders was issued to the press but did not mention the travel ban.  There was however an emphasis on the importance of Nato and the intention to “further deepen the already excellent bilateral relations in the coming years”.***********************************************************************The Government is to outline a series of tweaks to planning laws it says will help solve the housing shortage. Ministers want to require councils to come with a local plan to meet housing demand in an area, give them more powers to speed up developments, and require developers to use land more efficiently. Crucially, the Government’s long awaited housing white paper includes measures that would effectively scrap the Coalition 2010 housebuilding planning framework and return to a system that bears stronger similarities to the one they inherited from Labour in 2010. The Coalition government abolished nationally set housing targets and allowed local councils to estimate their own housing demanding using local methods. As a result, 40 per cent of planning authorities do not have an up to date plan to meet demand, Government sources admitted on Monday night. Under the last Labour government housing requirements were calculated nationally and then distributed to local councils, who had to set a plan to meet demand. The Government now plans to return to a nationally standardised way of calculating housing demand in an area, and again require councils to draw up plans. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said “ambitious” measures would get more homes built in areas where people live. Labour branded the new policies “feeble beyond belief” and said that the housing crisis was getting worse despite hundreds of policy announcements. Other measures included in the white paper include a stipulation that “starter homes” be reserved for people with incomes of below £80,000 and an unspecified push to encourage longer-term tenancies in the rental market. Councils will be allowed to issue “completion notices” requiring a construction produce to be completed within two years of construction starting. They can currently require that it be completed within three years. The Government will also stipulate that homes are built at a higher density where there are shortages – meaning taller blocks rather than detached houses with big gardens in those areas. Shadow Secretary of State for Housing John Healey said: “The measures announced so far in Theresa May’s long-promised housing white paper are feeble beyond belief. “After seven years of failure and 1000 housing announcements, the housing crisis is getting worse not better. “There are 200,000 fewer home-owners, homelessness has doubled, and affordable house-building has slumped to a 24-year low.” He said the policies were “a white flag not a white paper”. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid will say on Tuesday: “Walk down your local high street today and there’s one sight you’re almost certain to see. Young people, faces pressed against the estate agent’s window, trying and failing to find a home they can afford. “With prices continuing to sky rocket, if we don’t act now, a whole generation could be left behind.  We need to do better, and that means tackling the failures at every point in the system. “The housing market in this country is broken and the solution means building many more houses in the places that people want to live. “Today we are setting out ambitious proposals to help fix the housing market so that more ordinary working people from across the country can have the security of a decent place to live.  The only way to halt the decline in affordability and help more people onto the housing ladder is to build more homes. Let’s get Britain building.”***********************************************************************Around 80 protesters blockaded the entrance to a central London hotel that was due to host a meeting of prominent far-right voices. On Saturday, The Kensington Holiday Inn was due to host a meeting of The London Forum, which London Anti-Fascists describe as a ‘neo Nazi, white supremacist’ organisation. Their previous meetingshosted notorious historian and Holocaust denier David Irving. The organisation has been contacted for comment. An exposé of one of their previous meetings reported speakers urging the audience to “identify, counter and break Jewish-Zionist domination". The group was due to hear from keynote speaker Jason Reza Jorjani, close associate of American white supremacist Richard Spencer, who shot to prominence when footage of his colleagues giving Nazi salutes following a speech went viral. Also on the bill was Ian Millard, a former barrister who was barred from practising after expressing his admiration for Adolf Hitler. However, activists told The Independent the meeting was unable to go ahead as planned after they stopped attendees entering and leaving the building. Police were called to the Holiday Inn, but there was no confrontation between protesters and London Forum members. A spokesperson for London Anti-Fascists told The Independent: “These meetings are a recruiting ground for organised fascists - the kind who are happy to make Nazi salutes in public as well as the more insidious. "Nearly every neo-Nazi protest held in London over the past few years can be linked back to this series of meetings. “The London Forum has been running since 2012 and has expanded across the country/There are regular meetings linked to it in the South West, Wales, Yorkshire and New York. The YouTube channel which they use to promote these events has clocked up more than 500,000 views." “We need to take direct action to shut these meetings down and prevent a fascist movement from emerging.” The Kensington Holiday Inn declined to comment on the incident.***********************************************************************NICOSIA, Cyprus — As the United Nations geared up for negotiations that it declared the “best and last chance” to unite Cyprus after more than four decades of acrimonious division, Russia’s ambassador attended a seminar dedicated to derailing any prospect of an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The presence of the ambassador, Stanislav Osadchiy, delighted hard-line Greek Cypriot politicians in Nicosia, the capital of the Greek-speaking south of the divided island. They had helped torpedo a 2004 reunification plan supported by the United States and have now rallied together to defeat a new push for a settlement that began on Jan. 12 with an international conference in Geneva. But Mr. Osadchiy’s attendance at the seminar, which Western and other diplomats shunned, angered Nicos Anastasiades, the Greek-Cypriot president of the Republic of Cyprus and a strong supporter of efforts to resolve an interethnic dispute as intractable and nearly as protracted as the Israel-Palestine conflict. In an interview in Nicosia, Mr. Anastasiades said that, when questioned, the ambassador had apologized and said he had misunderstood the nature of the seminar, despite its clear anti-settlement agenda and the fact that it had been organized by five small political parties all bitterly opposed to a compromise deal in Geneva. Continue reading the main story. The president said he accepted the ambassador’s explanation and his insistence that he had not meant to endorse the so-called rejectionists by attending. But, Mr. Anastasiades added, “I consider any intervention by any third country as not what we are looking for.” Like countless previous diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus since Turkey invaded in 1974 and split the country in two, the recent Geneva talks failed to achieve a breakthrough, though they did make some progress. Mr. Anastasiades said the two sides were “halfway” to an agreement but still had deep divisions, notably on the issue of whether Turkey, Greece and Britain, the former colonial master, should retain their status as “guarantors” of the island’s security, a setup that Russia rejects. Bound to Russia by a shared Orthodox Christian faith and its role as a financial and banking center for Russian business, the Republic of Cyprus, the Greek-speaking nation in the south of the island, has long looked to Moscow as a protector rather than a troublemaker. But accusations that Moscow intervened to skew the United States presidential election and supported anti-establishment forces across Europe have stirred a wave of alarm about Russia in the European Union, of which the Republic of Cyprus is a member. This alarm, which Russia dismisses as Russophobic hysteria, has given new force to voices in Cyprus warning that Russia’s geopolitical interests have made it determined to upset a Cyprus settlement. Makarios Drousiotis, a Greek-Cypriot researcher who has long bucked pro-Russian sentiment in Cyprus and sought to expose what he sees as Russian meddling, said events in the United States and Europe were shaking his compatriots’ view that Moscow had only their best interests at heart. “What they have been doing in America and Europe they have been doing for 50 years in Cyprus,” said Mr. Drousiotis, who in 2014 published a book, “The Cyprus Crisis and the Cold War,” that demolished what he called a Moscow-generated “myth” that the West is to blame for Turkey’s 1974 invasion of the island and the decades of division that followed. The book, denounced by Russia’s diplomatic mission in Nicosia as “politically unacceptable,” portrayed Moscow as a duplicitous partner that had for decades used disinformation, front organizations and other tools of subterfuge to woo support among Greek-Cypriots while working behind the scenes to stoke tensions to ensure that Cyprus never aligned too firmly with the West or became a NATO member.To Moscow’s fury, this once taboo view that Russia wants to block a settlement has in recent weeks been discussed openly in some Cypriot media outlets. The Cyprus Mail, for example, described Russia’s ambassador, Mr. Osadchiy, as “the darling” of anti-settlement forces “because he regularly says things aimed at undermining the talks or making the pursuit of a deal more difficult.” Maria Zakharova, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Moscow was “surprised by the anti-Russia comments in the Cyprus media” and accused the media of creating “a smoke screen for the real problems that need to be tackled as part of the Cypriot settlement.” Mr. Drousiotis said the Russian ambassador’s apparent support for so-called rejectionist politicians ahead of the Geneva talks fit a long, but previously mostly ignored, pattern. “Every time there has been an attempt to solve the Cyprus issue, the Russians have jumped in to block a settlement,” Mr. Drousiotis said. A solution in Cyprus would end a deep rift within NATO between Turkey and Greece, both members, and open the way to the development of large gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean that could upset the grip of Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled energy giant, on the Turkish market. Turkey imports nearly 99 percent of its natural gas, more than half from Russia, its biggest supplier by far. Gas from Egyptian, Israeli and Cypriot fields in the Mediterranean would be cheaper than supplies from Gazprom, but it has little chance of reaching Turkish consumers so long as arguments over territorial waters and other matters between Greek and Turkish Cypriots obstruct the development of pipelines. In 2004, ahead of a referendum in Cyprus on whether to accept a reunification plan proposed by Kofi Annan, who was the secretary general of the United Nations at the time, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution relating to security arrangements on the island that all other Council members supported. Hopes for the so-called Annan plan then took another big blow when AKEL, the influential pro-Moscow communist party in southern Cyprus, dropped its previous support and, on the eve of the referendum, urged voters to reject the plan, as did the Orthodox Church. In the end, the north voted to accept the plan, while voters in the south rejected it. Yet another international effort collapsed after hackers penetrated the United Nations computer system and, in 2009, leaked emails and documents to a pro-Russian Cypriot newspaper. Some of the documents were doctored in a way that inflamed Greek-Cypriot fears of any settlement. The United Nations concluded that only a foreign intelligence service could have orchestrated such an operation. Mr. Anastasiades, speaking at the presidential palace in Nicosia, said that his country counted Russia as a friend, but that it had to take care not to give fuel to those who questioned Russia’s intentions, as the ambassador did by attending the seminar. Russia has responded angrily to accusations that it has been working against its own stated policy in favor of a Cyprus solution. Vladimir A. Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, issued a scathing statement on Jan. 13 to denounce what he called “preposterous” reports that Russia wanted to block a settlement. “Evidently, anti-Russian hysteria is becoming contagious. Overzealous fighters of the (dis)information front are working day and night trying to implicate Russia in all sorts of problems, including those that are the direct result of shortsighted and arrogant policies of others,” Mr. Chizhov, a veteran diplomat who earlier served at the embassy in Nicosia, said in the statement. Harry Tzimitras, director of the Nicosia branch of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said many obstacles blocked a settlement irrespective of Russia, notably the gulf between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the issue of whether the Turkish military should be allowed to keep troops on the island after reunification. “The fundamental mistrust” between the two sides, Mr. Tzimitras said, is the main reason for the failure of decades of diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement. “In Cyprus, you rarely fight facts,” he said. “You fight perceptions and ghosts.” All the same, he added, some think that Russia has many reasons, despite its public position, to want the island to stay divided. “In this view, the status quo is working very well for Russia,” Mr. Tzimitras said. “They don’t want it disrupted.” Aside from strengthening NATO and damaging Gazprom, a reunification deal would deliver a success to the United States, whose diplomats have been particularly active in trying to prod Greece, Turkey and their ethnic kin in Cyprus toward an agreement. Mr. Anastasiades said the main obstacle to a solution was Turkey, whose increasingly autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, recently said Turkish troops must be allowed to stay in Cyprus “forever.” Mr. Anastasiades has forged good relations with the leader of Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akinci, but, he said, “the solution does not depend on the Turkish Cypriots but on Ankara’s will.” The issue of troops is tightly connected with another big hurdle — demands by Mr. Anastasiades, urged on by Russia, that Turkey, Greece and Britain be stripped of their role as guarantors. Moscow has long wanted to scrap this system, continuing a Soviet-era policy that was based in part on its desire to weaken the role of Britain, a NATO member that has military bases and a listening post in Cyprus. Mr. Anastasiades said it was up to Mr. Erdogan to decide what he wanted. “His rhetoric is that he is in favor, but what remains to be seen is whether in practice he is supporting a solution,” Mr. Anastasiades said. As for Russia and the United States, Mr. Anastasiades said, Cyprus understands “the games superpowers play.” “We want the support of everyone who can give support,” he added. “It is a matter of survival.”***********************************************************************The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is to face trial for alleged fraudulent financing of his failed 2012 bid for re-election, a legal source has said. The case centres on an alleged system of false accounting used by Sarkozy’s office to conceal an enormous campaign overspend, mainly on the lavish rallies and US-style stadium gigs that cemented Sarkozy’s reputation as a political showman. The limit on presidential campaign spending in France is €22.5m (£19.5m), and investigators suspect Sarkozy’s campaign spent €23m on top of that. Sarkozy has always denied any wrongdoing in the case, or even any knowledge of Bygmalion, an events company that allegedly concealed the overspend. The case has become known as the “Bygmalion affair”. The company allegedly wrote fake invoices and falsely charged €18.5m to Sarkozy’s rightwing party – then called the UMP, since renamed Les Républicains – instead of billing the president’s campaign. Sarkozy’s rallies during his 2012 election battle against the Socialist François Hollande were theatrical mega-productions, slickly coordinated by dedicated film directors, with specially laid carpet for his luxury dressing rooms and tens of thousands of euros spent on French flags to be waved by a sea of adoring fans. But questions were asked over how the costly rallies were paid for. Bygmalion executives have acknowledged the existence of fraud and false accounting and the trial will focus on whether Sarkozy was aware of it or made decisions about it. A legal source told AFP that Serge Tournaire, one of two judges in charge of the case, had decided on 3 February that the case should go to trial after Sarkozy failed in a legal effort to prevent it in December. Sarkozy’s lawyer has announced plans to appeal. One other former president – Jacques Chirac – has been tried in France’s fifth republic, which was founded in 1958. Chirac was given a two-year suspended jail term in 2011 after being found guilty of embezzling public funds to illegally finance the rightwing party he led. He was the first former French head of state to face prosecution since the second world war. Questioned by police in September 2015, Sarkozy said he did not recall ever being warned about the accounting and described the controversy as a “farce”, putting the responsibility squarely on Bygmalion and the UMP. Sarkozy’s ambitions to one day return to lead France were dealt a blow when he was eliminated in November in the first round of a primary contest to choose the right’s presidential candidate. Sarkozy trailed the eventual winner, François Fillon, and the former prime minister Alain Juppé. Details of Sarkozy’s costly 2012 campaign and the role Bygmalion played have been reported by the investigative journalist Violette Lazard in a book, Big Magouilles. At one rally of 10,000 supporters in Nice, she claimed that luxury backstage canapés and champagne were provided for VIP supporters of the teetotal Sarkozy. Scrambled eggs and spaghetti were infused with so much luxury truffle that one party worker worried the intense smell would waft out over the audience. “I was very embarrassed, wondering if the smell would reach the hall and what image that would create,” the unnamed party worker told Lazard. The backstage drinks and nibbles cost €50 a head. Luxurious backstage dressing rooms were hastily put up for Sarkozy at conference centres and halls. At one rally in Villepinte, north of Paris, builders put up “not just a dressing room but an apartment”, according to a party official who was investigated in the case. He described “four rooms with an office, a reception room, toilets, a bathroom and a sort of antechamber where visitors could wait”. Before Sarkozy’s speech, 70,000 people stood chanting his name, but he did not hear it because the dressing room was entirely soundproofed at high cost, it is claimed. At other rallies, where the president would typically spend only moments backstage, furniture by the luxury brand Hermès was hired and arranged for him, temporary bathrooms and showers were fitted and once, in Lyon, €1,000 was spent on royal blue carpet for a dressing room used only briefly. Sarkozy’s team have repeatedly said they never demanded or asked for luxurious fittings. Sarkozy has always stressed he did not know anything about the spending or accounts, leaving that to his team. At a time when the right was pushing the notion of national identity, in one week in April 2012 Sarkozy’s campaign team spent a total of €42,964 on 65,000 French flags for spectators to wave. At an earlier meeting in Villepinte, €44,000 was spent on flags. Similarly, at one rally €10,000 was spent on blue fabric to dress the metal railings keeping the crowd back from Sarkozy, because it was felt that stark metal railings made him look too aloof from the crowd. One of the biggest spends was on giant video screens and the vast camera teams and established directors tasked with recording images to be fed to TV channels. Bygmalion is not the first funding investigation into Sarkozy’s campaigning. A judicial investigation is looking at allegations that his successful 2007 election campaign received illicit funding from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy has dimissed the allegations outright. His 2012 presidential campaign finances were rejected by an election watchdog and France’s highest constitutional body after he was officially found to have exceeded spending limits on a much smaller scale than the Bygmalion investigation is now looking into. After that ruling, Sarkozy’s indebted party was deprived of state subsidies as a punishment. In protest, Sarkozy launched a fundraising campaign known as the “Sarkothon” and raised €11m for the party.***********************************************************************MOSCOW — Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president, hardly misses a chance to talk tough on terrorism, once famously saying he would find Chechen terrorists sitting in the “outhouse” and “rub them out.” He and President Trump, notably dismissive of political correctness, would seem to have found common language on fighting terrorism — except on one point of, well, language. During his campaign, Mr. Trump associated Islam with terrorism and criticized President Obama for declining to use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism.” However, Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump so openly admires for his toughness, has, for more than a decade, done exactly what President Obama did. He has never described terrorists as “Islamic” and has repeatedly gone out of his way to denounce such language. “I would prefer Islam not be mentioned in vain alongside terrorism,” he said at a news conference in December, answering a question about the Islamic State, a group he often refers to as “the so-called Islamic State,” to emphasize a distinction with the Islamic religion. At the opening of a mosque in Moscow in 2015, Mr. Putin spoke of terrorists who “cynically exploit religious feelings for political aims.” In the Middle East, Mr. Putin said at the mosque opening, “terrorists from the so-called Islamic State are compromising a great world religion, compromising Islam, sowing hatred, killing people, including clergy,” and added that “their ideology is built on lies and blatant distortions of Islam.” He was careful to add, “Muslim leaders are bravely and fearlessly using their own influence to resist this extremist propaganda.” And, this being Russia, the failure to adhere to this Kremlin-determined interpretation is a prosecutable offense: The Russian news media are required by law to note in any mention of the Islamic State that the reference is to a banned terrorist organization of that name, lest it be misconstrued as denigrating religion. Mr. Putin does not take this stance to soothe the feelings of Western liberals, a group he dismisses as hypocritical in any case. “Putin prides himself on Russia’s intelligence capabilities,” the Brookings Institution wrote in a study of the early formation of his counterterrorism policies. “Russian leaders think they know their enemy,” and it is not the governments of majority Muslim countries such as Iraq and Iran, or the majority of Muslims living in Russia. Instead, Russian counterterrorism strategy focused on financing and militarily backing moderate Muslim leaders, with the breakthrough in the Chechen war coming when the region’s imam, Akhmad Kadyrov, allied with the Russian military. His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, leads the region today. While embracing Islamic leaders as a centerpiece of its counterterrorism strategy, however, the Kremlin did not avoid drawing distinctions along religious lines. The Russian government backed the Kadyrov family’s campaign to revive traditional Sufi Islam in Chechnya as a counterweight to the more austere Wahhabi denomination professed by many separatists. The Wahhabi strain was outlawed in another restive, predominantly Muslim province, Dagestan, and its adherents are persecuted in Russia, rights groups say. Still, the alliance with moderate Islamic religious leaders became important in pacifying Chechnya and other North Caucasus regions, which have ceased to pose a serious security threat to Russia. “Putin rules a multiconfessional country,” Orkhan Dzhemal, a commentator on Islamic affairs, said in a telephone interview, noting that in the United States, in contrast, Muslims are not a powerful political force. “He cannot say ‘Islamic terrorism’ for a simple reason. He doesn’t want to alienate millions of Russians.” The term preferred in Russian political parlance is “international terrorism.” In a phone call on Friday, President Trump and Mr. Putin discussed “real cooperation” in fighting terrorist groups in Syria. They could agree on an enemy. But the Kremlin statement described a “priority placed on uniting forces in the fight against the main threat — international terrorism.”***********************************************************************When Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, the Mexican secretary of the economy, came to talk to me last week about trade and the American elections, I didn’t expect him to drag up the old spat between Mexico and the United States over trucks. Back when it signed on to the North American Free Trade Agreement more than 20 years ago, the United States pledged that in the year 2000 it would lift restrictions that kept Mexican trucks from hauling cargo inside the United States, forcing them instead to dump their loads at the border. But when the time came, under pressure from the Teamsters and the union’s allies in Congress, Washington backed out. Mexico kept its cool for a while, though an arbitration panel in 2001 found the United States was in breach of the agreement. In 2007, Mexico accepted the George W. Bush administration’s request to cooperate in a pilot program that allowed a few Mexican trucks over the border, to prove that the rigs and their drivers posed no undue safety threat to the United States. But when Congress cut funding for the pilot program two years later, Mexico said enough. Mexico slapped retaliatory tariffs, ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent, on a list of products that amounted to over $2 billion in American exports to Mexico. It included apples from Washington — to help sway the views of Senator Patty Murray — and Christmas trees from Oregon, the homeland of Senator Ron Wyden, another critic of the cross-border trucking deal. Sure enough, common sense prevailed: On July 6, 2011, the two countries signed an agreement to allow Mexican trucks to operate in the United States. On Oct. 21, 2011, the first Mexican truck rumbled across, and the last retaliatory tariff was removed. Few, if any, countries would be as vulnerable to a Trump presidency as Mexico. About $4 of every $5 worth of goods that Mexico exports come to the United States. Some 35 percent of Mexican jobs depend directly on foreign trade. Mexico’s future relies on North American integration. “That’s Mexico’s vulnerability,” said Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City. “There is nothing more important in Mexico than Nafta.” The Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has already tripped over himself trying to deal with Donald J. Trump. Many Mexicans felt betrayed when Mr. Peña Nieto invited Mr. Trump to a meeting in Mexico City, sending his low approval ratings plummeting further. And the meeting hardly improved relations. Hostilities broke out as soon as it was over. The minister of the economy, Mr. Guajardo Villarreal, argues there is little point for Mexico to respond now to Mr. Trump’s threats to wall off the Mexican people and slap a 35 percent tariff on Mexican imports. “We must not overreact to campaign rhetoric,” he told me. Still, the truck story suggests the Mexican government understands that it needs a contingency plan in case Mexico’s most important partner on the world stage were to suddenly turn hostile. The outline of a strategy seems clear: Mexico must communicate to the United States just how valuable their relationship is, and how self-destructive it could be to undermine it. The question is how to make this case. How persuasive can Mexico be? A slide from a presentation that Mr. Guajardo Villarreal and his aides carry with them as they speak to American business and political leaders shows what the 2017 Ford Fusion, made in Hermosillo, in northern Mexico, would cost if a 35 percent tariff were imposed on imports from Mexico: $30,253, which is almost $8,000 more than it costs now. Another slide shows that eight of 10 avocados consumed in the United States are grown in Mexico, as are nine of 10 limes and half of all tomatoes. Six million American jobs also depend on exports to Mexico, one slide says. Mexico buys nearly $250 billion worth of stuff from the United States. And 37 cents out of each dollar’s worth of Mexican exports to the United States came from the United States in the form of parts and other components. “If you throw obstacles at the relationship with Mexico, you would be shooting yourself in the foot,” Mr. Guajardo Villarreal told me. Allies in the United States would indeed help Mexico make its case, including states and municipalities that would be hurt by Nafta’s unraveling, and businesses that would be forced to relocate production and rethink their global supply chains. But perhaps a more muscular approach is needed. Jorge Castañeda, a former Mexican foreign minister who is a harsh critic of Mr. Peña Nieto, suggests that Mexico’s best argument is that the country’s stability and prosperity are indispensable for the national security of the United States. Americans worried about illegal immigration across the southern border might stop to consider what it could look like if the Mexican economy went into a tailspin. If this argument fails to persuade, Mr. Castañeda argues, there are other tools in the toolbox. Say Mexico demanded that the United States prove that a migrant was Mexican before it would accept her back into the country. It could deploy American courts and regulations against Mr. Trump’s wall, pushing for things like environmental impact assessments. “We should throw as many monkey wrenches into the works as possible,” Mr. Castañeda said. And together with Canada, Mexico should sue in every court — under the provisions of Nafta, the World Trade Organization and the United States — to resist Mr. Trump’s protectionist agenda. A big question remains, however: If a Trump administration were to follow through on its threats — breaking the rules of Nafta and the W.T.O. — how strongly should Mexico retaliate? It has shown it knows how. In the truck spat, Mexico picked political targets skillfully. It avoided shooting itself in the foot when it retaliated against Christmas trees rather than car engines. “Mexico has been very good at trying to follow the rules of trade agreements when it has run into trade frictions with the United States,” said Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Yet, as Mr. Bown observed, in the early days of a Trump administration — when he wouldn’t be worried about re-election — “what products would you pick?” A trade war would certainly hurt the United States. Scholars at the Peterson Institute modeled what would happen if America were to slap sky-high tariffs on Mexico and China and they were to reply in kind: By 2019, the trade war would cost hundreds of billions of dollars in lost output and would result in the loss of nearly 4.8 million private sector jobs. The problem for Mexico is that the damage to its own economy would be much larger. “If we are to go to war, of course we have rifles,” Mr. Rubio said. But the economic weapons his country has at its disposal, he added, are like “nuclear bombs that you can’t use.” Lamenting their luck, Mexicans often say, “Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States.” Facing the prospect of a Trump presidency, many Mexicans would hope their northern neighbor were farther away. But Mexico’s prosperity depends on a closer relationship with the United States, not a weaker one. The best approach to a Trump administration may be to hunker down and wait for his successor.***********************************************************************The Government refused to stop the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia after it was privately advised to do so by the top civil servant in charge of weapons exports control, a court has heard. Edward Bell, head of the Government’s Export Control Organisation, told the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, that it would be “prudent and cautious” to stop selling to the Saudi regime amid widespread reports of war crimes by its military in Yemen. Campaigners today began a legal challenge against the Government in a bid to force ministers to stop issuing export licences for weapons to the autocratic state. In an email from February 2016 presented to the High Court in London, Mr Bell said: “To be honest – and I was very directly and honest with the Secretary of State – my gut tells me we should suspend.” “This would be prudent and cautious given the acknowledged gaps in knowledge about Saudi operations. I put this directly to the Secretary of State in these terms.” Ministers have also publicly been advised to stop sales by MPs on the International Development Committee, the Business Committee, as well as by the European Parliament. The meeting with Mr Javid was said in the email to have taken place on 10 February 2016 and the email was dated the day after, the court saw. In separate evidence presented to the court, the head of policy at the Export Control Organisation is quoted as saying the organisation has “significant concerns regarding the acknowledged gaps in knowledge about Saudi targeting processes and about the military objectives of some of the strikes”. The Ministry of Defence were not able to identify a “valid military target” for all the air strikes Saudi Arabian forces had carried out, the head of policy says – only a majority. “They cannot be certain that the vast majority of total air strikes that are not being tracked have all been IHL-compliant,” it concludes. Human rights groups say more than 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen as the Saudi Arabian-led coalition intervenes in the country’s civil war. Schools, hospitals, and food factories have reportedly been hit while the United Nations has declared the situation a “humanitarian catastrophe”. Campaign Against Arms Trade says the Government is unlawfully failing to suspend the sale of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, despite evidence that the Gulf state is guilty of “repeated and serious breaches” of international humanitarian law. More than £3.3bn worth of arms has been licenced to Saudi Arabia since the bombing began in March 2015. The Government says there is no “clear risk” that UK-licensed items might be used to commit a serious violation of humanitarian law. Sajid Javid is no longer in charge of arms exports, the policy area now being the responsibility of Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade. A Government spokesperson declined to comment on the court case but said: “The UK is playing a leading role in work to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen and to address the humanitarian crisis. “We operate one of the most robust export control regimes in the world and keep our defence exports to Saudi Arabia under careful and continual review. Given the current legal proceedings we will not be commenting further outside of court at this stage.”***********************************************************************A new scheme that hopes to encourage refugees from Syria and other nations to start new lives in Asia and Latin America is to be funded by the British government, Theresa May has said. The commitment, part of a package of measures to help alleviate the crisis of migrants and refugees seeking to reach Europe via the Mediterranean, forms part of £30m in funding announced by Downing Street at an EU summit in Malta. Among measures intended to reduce the flow of people seeking to reach Europe is £2.5m in UK funding for a UN-organised scheme intended to see richer nations help countries in Asia and Latin America accept and support some refugees. The spending will include supplies for thousands of refugees facing desperate conditions in Greece and eastern Europe, including warm clothes, shelter and medical care. There is also a special UK fund to support vulnerable female refugees travelling alone. The voluntary programme, officially called the emerging resettlement countries joint support mechanism, is at an early stage – none of the host countries has yet been confirmed – but is intended to help both the refugees and the countries they arrive in. It would see countries get help building factories or other infrastructure for the new arrivals, who would provide manual labour and in some cases skills, such as those of engineers or doctors, many of whom have fled Syria. Jointly run by the UN refugee agency and the International Organisation for Migration, the scheme is intended to help up to 30,000 people move over three years. The total cost is expected to be about £90m. It was first announced as part of a UN summit on refugees held in September. The international development secretary, Priti Patel, whose department jointly made the announcement, said Britain was “stepping up its support for the most vulnerable refugees who are at risk and need our help”. “This latest support from the UK will help those who decide they want to return home to do so safely, protect men, women and children from exploitation, and ensure that those caught in freezing conditions get the basic help they need to survive,” she said.***********************************************************************America has been here before. At the dawn of the 20th century, the economy was already well into a fundamental transformation of the labor force, as industry replaced farming and crafts as the primary source of new jobs. The shift was painful, spawning protest movements and political forces like progressivism. But the United States emerged from the turmoil far more prosperous and powerful. Νοtably, the jobs of the new industrial economy were generally more productive and better paid than the jobs it left behind. The nation is well on its way through a second transition, this time to a postindustrial economy with little factory work to be had. Even as industrial production has grown, the economy has shed seven million manufacturing jobs since 1980. Manufacturing’s share of employment has shrunk to 8.5 percent of nonfarm jobs from a peak of nearly 27 percent in 1920. For politicians on the campaign trail and in Washington struggling to come up with a credible strategy to improve the fortunes of America’s understandably angry working class, that shift poses an unanswered question: Where will new, better jobs come from?
Epochal transformations like these are complicated. They are difficult to understand, let alone manage, and are driven not only by domestic forces but also by global dynamics over which American politicians have limited control. During much of the 19th and 20th centuries, government at multiple levels played an essential role in shaping the nation’s transition from farms and small towns to cities and factories. It could do so again. What has stopped it is not the lack of practical ideas but the encrusted ideological opposition to government activism of any kind. The construction jobs once fueled by the housing bubble that burst so violently in 2008 are unlikely to return anytime soon. The jobs picking up the slack today are in retail sales or cleaning buildings, paying little more than $26,000 a year; they are cashier positions paying $21,000, or food-prep jobs paying less than $20,000. Some growing occupations pay a decent wage: registered nurses earn $71,000 a year, on average. But these examples are the exception, not the norm. Though the decline of well-paid working class jobs is often portrayed as the inevitable consequence of globalization and technological change, it is in large part the result of a failure of government. An observation has recently popped up in the academic debate — in books such as “Concrete Economics” (Harvard Business Review Press) by J. Bradford DeLong and Stephen Cohen, and in “American Amnesia” (Simon and Schuster) by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson. They point out that for all our love of rugged individualism, government played a large and underappreciated role in reshaping the American economy before — and it could do so again. Start with high tariffs against imports imposed from the time of Alexander Hamilton, to help foster America’s industrial development. Then huge grants of land to build railways in the 19th century not only opened up the West, they vastly increased productivity in agriculture. From catalog retailing to centralized meatpacking, the railways enabled innovations that spawned entire industries. The government also played a crucial role on the other side of this transformation: bolstering workers’ human capital. From the Land-Grant College Act of 1862, which created a network of public universities, to the offer in the G.I. Bill of Rights to pay for the college education of veterans returning from World War II, the federal government invested aggressively in higher education. In the early decades of the 20th century, local governments across the country poured money and resources into an impressive expansion of secondary education. Between 1910 and 1940, the high school graduation rate of American 18-year-olds increased to 50 percent from 9 percent. Finally, the government directly created jobs — whether in the burst of infrastructure investment in the 1930s that gave us the Hoover Dam, among other huge projects, or the tenfold increase in federal spending from 1939 to 1945 as the government built up the military-industrial complex to fight Germany and Japan. Why American politics turned against this successful model of pragmatic policy-making remains controversial. Perhaps it was the increasing footprint of money in politics, which has given more clout to corporate interests lobbying for smaller government and lower taxes. Maybe desegregation led to increasing distrust in government by white voters. Perhaps it was the combination of a recession and high inflation of the 1970s, which discredited interventionist government policies. In any event, there is much the government could do. Start with investment in the nation’s crumbling infrastructure: Lawrence Summers, once the top economic adviser to President Obama, never tires of repeating that this not only is urgently needed but is almost guaranteed to be profitable, given rock-bottom interest rates. While it might not increase employment by tens of millions, as these jobs tend to require high skills, even a relatively small number of construction jobs would provide a needed economic boost. Then there are health care and education, critical sectors that are growing as a share of the economy and will provide many of the jobs of our future. For both good and ill, they are already deeply entwined with the government. To be sure, that raises additional challenges: Republican governors refusing to expand Medicaid, for example. But it also offers an opportunity for the government to shape, through its power as a regulator and a contractor of private services, the kinds of jobs these industries will offer. Why not insist that home health aides acquire a certain set of skills and be paid accordingly? “The huge issue going forward is, are we going to care for the elderly with a bunch of minimum-wage workers or people with a better certification offering better care for better pay?” asked Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard University. “There is a potential win-win situation where workers and patients end up in better shape.” Similarly, the government has enormous leverage to improve the quality of college education by tightening rules on for-profit universities that feed from the trough of federal funds. A better path than funneling so much money to low-quality for-profits would probably be to help finance public universities and community colleges. Not only would that improve the skills of American workers, which are still considered among the poorest in the industrialized world, but it would also probably improve the wages and working conditions of teachers. The good news is that the United States may have the best opportunity in decades to overcome its anti-government political biases. Donald J. Trump, the admittedly unusual Republican standard-bearer, has publicly called for extensive public investment in infrastructure. More orthodox Republicans, like the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, are also expressing interest in using government levers to tackle the lack of prospects for so many American workers. There are several levers available. The federal government could try to rebuild a quality bureaucracy, rather than subcontract so much of its work to expensive consultants and bottom-end contractors that employ the cheapest workers available. It could invest more in research and development, which has flatlined over the past several years. So what’s holding us back? The loss of a vision, once shared across much of the ideological spectrum, of what government can accomplish, when it is allowed to do its job.***********************************************************************Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has indicated the government is willing to negotiate the passage of its childcare reforms, paid for by cuts to family tax benefits. The government is keen to support families to get better quality childcare with legislation expected to be put to the parliament during the autumn session. The government plans to introduce an omnibus bill that will see lower income families better off for childcare. To pay for the changes the government will cut some family benefits, including the end of year supplement for people on Family Tax Part A and Part B. 'As a government we have shown we are very willing to pragmatically negotiate and we will continue to do that,' Senator Cormann told ABC. Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has told Sky News says his party will consider the changes. 'It depends how you structure it and that's something we will talk to all the stakeholders, including people like ACOSS, about their concerns. 'I also under the imperative the government has that their concerned about the Triple A credit rating, about losing that rating. 'And if the government doesn't get certain savings it will look at increasing taxes.' Shadow childcare minister Kate Ellis says the opposition will not support paying for the bill by stripping family tax benefits. 'What we cannot support and have made very clear is that we don't think that other low and middle income Australian families should have to pay this. We don't think the Family tax benefit cuts should be linked as a way of holding the parliament to ransom.'***********************************************************************More than 100 companies, including most of high-tech's biggest names, joined a legal brief opposing President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban, arguing that it would give companies strong incentives to move jobs outside the United States. The companies - including Apple Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft - banded together late on Sunday to file a "friend-of-the-court" brief with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. They argued that the executive order temporarily banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees "inflicts significant harm on American business."Elon Musk's Tesla Inc and SpaceX were among other companies signing onto the brief on Monday, raising the number of signatories to 127. Musk is among the few tech executives on Trump's business advisory council. He has been forced to defend his participation in recent days, particularly since Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] chief executive, Travis Kalanick, quit the group on Thursday following the travel ban. The new Republican president's Jan. 27 executive order sparked protests and chaos at U.S. and overseas airports in the weekend that followed. Trump has defended the ban as necessary to ensure tougher vetting of people coming into the United States and better protect the country from the threat of terror attacks. On Friday, U.S District Judge James Robart in Seattle, ruling on a lawsuit challenging the order filed by Washington state and Minnesota, temporarily lifted the ban. The federal government appealed the decision, which was heavily criticized by Trump. In their brief, the companies argued that the order created uncertainty for companies depending on talent from overseas and global business travel to innovate and create jobs in the United States. "Highly skilled immigrants will be more interested in working abroad, in places where they and their colleagues can travel freely and with assurance that their immigration status will not suddenly be revoked," the brief said. "Multinational companies will have strong incentives ... to base operations outside the United States or to move or hire employees and make investments abroad." "Ultimately, American workers and the economy will suffer as a result," the companies argued. A major theme of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign was bringing back jobs he said had been moved to other countries. Responding to the lawsuit, the federal government argued in legal filings that the president was exercising his constitutional authority to control U.S. borders and that the law allows him to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners who "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States." Companies that initially joined the brief included Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc, Intel Corp, eBay Inc, Netflix Inc and Uber Technologies Inc, as well as non-tech corporations such as Levi Strauss & Co and Chobani Llc. The brief hailed the contributions inclusive immigration policies have made to the American economy. It said that immigrants or their children have founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. Trump's agenda on immigration, trade, cyber security, tax reform and other issues has caused deep consternation in the tech industry. Before the travel ban, most companies said they wanted to work with him and avoided any direct confrontations. But the immigration restrictions provoked a broad backlash in Silicon Valley, where foreign-born nationals are an integral part of the tech economy. There have been peaceful protests at Google and Facebook. Uber was the target of a boycott, and scrambled to reassure its many immigrant drivers that it was on their side. Partly because of pressure from their rank-and-file, big tech companies have separated themselves from much of corporate America in directly confronting Trump policies. Only a handful of non-tech companies joined the friend-of-the-court brief, though some of the lawyers involved said that was mainly because the group came together very quickly through personal contacts.***********************************************************************In all that is being said about Theresa May, Brexit and her relations with Donald Trump, little attention has been given to the extraordinary workload of the Prime Minister. At the end of last month, May spent Thursday and Friday in Washington to meet the new US President. She then flew to Turkey on Saturday. On Monday she went to Cardiff to meet the leaders of the devolved administrations who each have concerns about Brexit, and on Tuesday she travelled to Dublin to meet the leadership of the EU member state with most reason to be concerned about the UK’s intended departure. On Wednesday she was back in the House of Commons for her weekly session of Prime Minister’s Questions. But by Friday was on the move again, heading to Malta for the informal meeting with EU leaders. The Prime Minister must play her best possible game at a series of highly-charged European summits and council meetings. There will inevitably be one key theme of the main international forums including the G8 and G20, and even the Nato summit and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting: everyone wants to talk to her about Brexit. But how is the Prime Minister to cope with Brexit while running the country with a small majority? What about her domestic policies? She needs support. May cannot and should not delegate responsibility for Brexit to her ministerial colleagues. It is the issue that will define her premiership and she must be seen to take personal responsibility for it. The same argument applies to the wider diplomatic agenda which is so dominated by Brexit. Equally, she needs to keep a tight rein on her three cabinet colleagues with responsibility for Brexit: Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox. She cannot give any one of the three ascendancy over the other two. But where else can she look for help? Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, is the ultimate safe pair of hands. Sometimes rather dry in tone, Hammond is of one mind with the Prime Minister on matters economic. She need not worry that he needs watching, but he does not need the distraction of a second job overseeing his cabinet colleagues. The potential so far unseen hazards for May’s Government are not so much on the foreign or economic desks but on the home front. The strain on the NHS, the crisis in social care, the housing shortage, continuing chaos on the railways, discontent in the prisons. Any one of these – let alone two or three in combination – could provoke a serious political crisis. The UK’s second female PM should perhaps remind herself that Margaret Thatcher – who saw off General Galtieri and the National Union of Mineworkers – was brought down by the seemingly dull issue of local government finance. May has also pledged to preserve the United Kingdom. It used to be said of David Cameron that if he lost the referendum on independence for Scotland he would be remembered for nothing else. He will now be remembered for his failure in a different referendum. The vacant title of The Prime Minister Who Broke The Union is May’s for the taking. To avoid such ignominies, the Prime Minister should appoint a senior minister who should handle relations with the nations and the regions of the United Kingdom; to look for compromises and ways to cement the United Kingdom together, while she detaches the country from the European Union. The Prime Minister simply does not have the time to do all the jobs currently on her plate. Working with the devolved administrations, overseeing domestic policy, chairing Cabinet committees and knocking ministerial heads together, is a job for a deputy prime minister. Looking around her Cabinet table, few of May’s colleagues meet the dual criteria for the role of deputy: the authority to do the job but without appearing to be an alternative PM should the challenge of Brexit prove too great for May herself. Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, and Damian Green, Work and Pensions Secretary, are perhaps best qualified on grounds of loyalty and gravitas. Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, and the Chancellor too obviously possible successors to the top and each is already holding down a big job. The role of DPM should not be combined with running a major department. An able and loyal deputy who enjoys the Prime Minister’s full backing should be an asset to May. And just in case anyone is tempted to suggest that appointing one might be interpreted as a sign of weakness, it is worth noting that Churchill, Attlee and Blair each had a Deputy PM throughout their time at Number 10 – as did Mrs Thatcher during her more successful first two terms. And on a more cautionary note, Anthony Eden, Alec Douglas-Home, Jim Callaghan and Gordon Brown were happy to do without.***********************************************************************The Government refused to stop the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia after it was privately advised to do so by the top civil servant in charge of weapons exports control, a court has heard. Edward Bell, head of the Government’s Export Control Organisation, told the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, that it would be “prudent and cautious” to stop selling to the Saudi regime amid widespread reports of war crimes by its military in Yemen. Campaigners today began a legal challenge against the Government in a bid to force ministers to stop issuing export licences for weapons to the autocratic state. In an email from February 2016 presented to the High Court in London, Mr Bell said: “To be honest – and I was very directly and honest with the Secretary of State – my gut tells me we should suspend.” “This would be prudent and cautious given the acknowledged gaps in knowledge about Saudi operations. I put this directly to the Secretary of State in these terms.” Ministers have also publicly been advised to stop sales by MPs on the International Development Committee, the Business Committee, as well as by the European Parliament. The meeting with Mr Javid was said in the email to have taken place on 10 February 2016 and the email was dated the day after, the court saw. In separate evidence presented to the court, the head of policy at the Export Control Organisation is quoted as saying the organisation has “significant concerns regarding the acknowledged gaps in knowledge about Saudi targeting processes and about the military objectives of some of the strikes”. The Ministry of Defence were not able to identify a “valid military target” for all the air strikes Saudi Arabian forces had carried out, the head of policy says – only a majority. “They cannot be certain that the vast majority of total air strikes that are not being tracked have all been IHL-compliant,” it concludes. Human rights groups say more than 10,000 people have been killed in Yemen as the Saudi Arabian-led coalition intervenes in the country’s civil war. Schools, hospitals, and food factories have reportedly been hit while the United Nations has declared the situation a “humanitarian catastrophe”. Campaign Against Arms Trade says the Government is unlawfully failing to suspend the sale of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, despite evidence that the Gulf state is guilty of “repeated and serious breaches” of international humanitarian law. More than £3.3bn worth of arms has been licenced to Saudi Arabia since the bombing began in March 2015. The Government says there is no “clear risk” that UK-licensed items might be used to commit a serious violation of humanitarian law. Sajid Javid is no longer in charge of arms exports, the policy area now being the responsibility of Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade. A Government spokesperson declined to comment on the court case but said: “The UK is playing a leading role in work to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen and to address the humanitarian crisis. “We operate one of the most robust export control regimes in the world and keep our defence exports to Saudi Arabia under careful and continual review. Given the current legal proceedings we will not be commenting further outside of court at this stage.”
