Cristiano Ronaldo has stepped in to help 80 dogs housed in a shelter facing financial difficulties, according to reports in his home country of Portugal. The Real Madrid forward, who turned 32 last week, has often been praised for his charity work, topping a list of the world’s most generous athletes in 2015. Ronaldo’s latest act of kindness came in response to a request from Cantinho da Lili, a dog rescue centre based in Gouveia which has struggled to meet veterinary bills of up to €2,000. After a volunteer at the centre contacted a friend of Ronaldo’s family, the Portugal international sent an autographed shirt to the centre, which will now be auctioned off to raise vital funds. “I want to thank Ronaldo from the bottom of my heart. It's a simple gesture, but very important,” Liliana Santos, one of workers at the dog shelter, told Correrio de Mahna. The shirt was sent to the shelter last November but was only received this week due to difficulties with the delivery. “The important thing is that it's already here and we still do not believe it," said Gloria Carvalho, the volunteer who initiated the contact with Ronaldo’s family. At the tail end of last year, Ronaldo sent a video message via his Instagram account to the children of Syria affected by the county’s long-running civil war, telling them they are “true heroes”. The former Manchester United forward also made a “generous donation” to Save the Children, the international non-governmental organisation, for whom he works as an ambassador.***********************************************************************Boos and whistles from Real Madrid’s supporters are ‘hurting’ Cristiano Ronaldo, according to his team-mate Keylor Navas. The Portugal international was heckled by sections of the Santiago Bernabeu during the opening stages of Madrid’s 3-0 La Liga win over Real Sociedad on Sunday. Television footage subsequently appeared to show Ronaldo responding in kind by mouthing an offensive Spanish phrase towards those in the stands. Navas has now revealed that, while Ronaldo retains great affection for Madridistas, the criticism he receives from his own supporters affects him. "What Cristiano tells us, and what he says to [Sergio] Ramos, the skipper, is that he loves all the fans,” he told Cadena Ser, in quotes reported by ESPN. "It hurts him that they whistle him, but he knows the [majority of the] fans support him. “He always tries to help the team with goals. He is committed to this club and wants to win trophies, as we all do, to make our fans happy.” Ronaldo responded to the jeers by scoring once and registering an assist in Sunday’s win over Real Sociedad and after the game, former Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas defend his old team-mate. Despite being a homegrown talent who went on to make 725 appearances for the club, Casillas himself was booed by the Bernabeu, particularly during the 2014/15 season, his final year. “As a Madridista, sometimes you don't understand why it can happen,” the 35-year-old, now playing for Porto, said. “Six months ago Madrid were European champions, one month ago they were world champions. He [Ronaldo] has just won the trophy as the world's best player. “If he scores two or three goals a game, that is just what he is supposed to do. It is madness. You must help him -have people around him and the club who help to protect the players. He must continue trying to be the player he is, the best in the world.”***********************************************************************Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm does not believe he will be able to maintain his high standards next year after announcing he will retire from football at the end of the season. The 33-year-old has a year left on his contract with the defending Bundesliga champions but will walk away early - also saying he has rejected an offer from the club to become a sporting director. He admits he has been considering his future for some time and will give his all for the rest of the campaign. "I'm going to stop playing football at the end of the season," the FC Bayern youth product confirmed on the club's official website following his team's 1-0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg in Tuesday evening's DFB Cup Round of 16 tie. "More than a year ago I started checking and questioning myself from day to day and week to week. I'm certain I'll maintain peak form through to the end of the season. I can manage that until the end of the campaign, but not beyond it." On the chance to join the club's backroom staff, he added: "There were talks, and in the end I decided it's not the right time for me to take up a new position at FC Bayern." Lahm announced the news after Bayern's 1-0 win over Wolfsburg in the DFB-Pokal, having made his 500th Bayern appearance against Schalke on Saturday. A World Cup winner with Germany, Lahm is aiming to win a record eighth Bundesliga title this season. The Munich-born player has spent his entire club career with Bayern, bar a two-year loan spell at Stuttgart between 2003 and 2005. He has won seven Bundesliga titles, six DFB-Pokals, the Champions League and the Club World Cup with Bayern. He captained Germany to World Cup glory in 2014 before announcing his retirement from international football.***********************************************************************The chairman of the Tokyo golf club that will host the 2020 Olympic Games has said that he is “baffled” by requests from the International Olympic Committee to lift the female membership ban that is currently in effect. Kasumigaseki Country Club in Saitama, north Tokyo, does not allow female members to join the private club and also prevents women from playing at the course on Sundays, meaning they can only play there as guests from Monday to Saturday. A board meeting on Tuesday decided to postpone a review into the membership policy, despite both the IOC and Tokyo’s governor, Yiriko Koike, calling on the Kasumigaseki club to change its stance on female members. Governor Koike said that she felt "uncomfortable that women cannot become full members in the 21st century," but course chairman Kiichi Kimura reaffirmed the club’s stance and hit out at the IOC and Japanese government for awarding them the tournament without consulting the club on its regulations. "It's extremely annoying the situation has evolved into what it is so quickly," Mr Kimura told local media after a board meeting resulted in no decision being made on lifting the ban on female members. "There was no decision and we will discuss it further. "We are baffled, that's our situation right now. We agreed (to host the Olympic golf competitions) at their request, but we never made a bid (to host it)." Tokyo 2020 organisers have also written to the club to express their concerns with the ruling, and its chief operating officer, Yukihiko Nunomura, told local reporters that he believes the club "will move towards operating with gender equality in mind".***********************************************************************Russia has admitted for the first time the existence of a widespread doping operation that took place over several years and had a major impact on the results of leading competitions like the Olympics, Paralympics and Winter Olympics. Canadian law professor Richard McLaren released the second part of his report into Russian doping, in which he accused the country of covering up a state-sponsored doping programme that took place from 2011 and 2016. Speaking to the New York Times, Russian officials did not dispute the accusations, although they do still insist that the doping scheme was not state-sponsored. "It was an institutional conspiracy," said Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia's national anti-doping agency. Professor McLaren's report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency [Wada] confirmed the claims made by Russia's former anti-doping laboratory chief Dr Grigory Rodchenkov, who told the New York Times in May that urine samples had been tampered with at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, while athletes were provided with cocktails of performing-enhancing drugs. Russian sports officials had vehemently denied the existence of any doping operation even as the International Olympic Committee opened disciplinary proceedings against several Russian athletes, while the country also lost the hosting rights to a number of international events. Russia's athletics team remains banned from competition by the International Association of Athletics Federation. But while officials have now conceded the existence of the operation, Antseliovich said it was "not state-sponsored". Vitaly Smirnov, the 81-year-old who has been a leading sports officials since the Soviet era and who has been appointed by Russian president Vladimir Putin to reform the anti-doping system, told the New York Times: "I don't want to speak for the people responsible." He added: "From my point of view, as a former minister of sport, president of Olympic committee - we made a lot of mistakes." Smirnov said it was important to find out why athletes had agreed to be doped, but also suggested the revelations made by the Fancy Bears - a group of hackers who have leaked the medical records of several athletes from around the world - showed Russia had not been competing on a level playing field. "Russia never had the opportunities that were given to other countries," Smirnov said. Last week, the IOC announced it has opened disciplinary proceedings against 28 Russian athletes who competed at the Winter Olympics in Sochi.Twenty-seven Russian athletes have already been sanctioned following re-analysis of samples from the summer Olympic Games in Beijing and London. The IOC will also re-analyse all samples from Russian athletes given at the Winter Games in Vancouver in 2010.***********************************************************************The Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana believes the lack of “winning” experience in the squad has cost them over the last month. Jürgen Klopp’s side have yet to win a Premier League match in 2017 and their run of two points from a possible 12 has seen them slip outside the top four for the first time since 24 September. The draw at home to league leaders Chelsea was expected to be the turning point to halt their slide but the team followed that up with defeat at struggling Hull City. Liverpool’s only league defeats this season have come against Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea City and Hull – all teams currently in the bottom nine. None of the Reds’ top-four rivals have a similar record with Chelsea losing only to Arsenal, Tottenham and Klopp’s side. Antonio Conte’s side have dropped just two points in 12 matches against the bottom 10 – grinding out 1-0 wins at Middlesbrough, Crystal Palace and Sunderland – and Lallana believes Liverpool need to discover something similar. “You can see [Chelsea] have a lot of experience and that they are used to winning,” said Lallana in the Liverpool Echo. “They know how to win games even when not at their best. You don’t have to always win by scoring five or six. Maybe that’s an area we need to improve on. We maybe need to realise how good we are at times. “Milly [James Milner] is probably the only one in our group who has that type of experience because it only comes from winning silverware like he did at Manchester City. Myself and the other players haven’t won titles or loads of cups so we need to learn from him and listen to him because that type of experience is vital. We need to learn and get back to winning ways in the league as soon as possible.” Being top of the table in November seems a long time ago now and the focus has shifted back to the pre-season aim of qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea are a distant 13 points ahead but the former Liverpool winger John Barnes believes the race for the top four will go right down to the wire with Everton, currently seventh, only 10 points from second-placed Tottenham. “I don’t think Chelsea are out of sight but Liverpool need to improve – the title race starts in March,” Barnes told the Evening Standard. “Liverpool can still finish in the top four if everyone gets behind Jürgen Klopp, who is a very good coach.”***********************************************************************Jürgen Klopp believes managers should be punished for disrespecting match officials but cannot be expected to give guarantees about their behaviour because of the extreme pressure of the Premier League. “Behind a manager is still a human being and we are all weak in parts,” he said. The Liverpool manager said he was fortunate to escape a sanction for his outburst towards Neil Swarbrick on Tuesday, when he yelled “Nobody can beat us” in the face of the fourth official after Simon Mignolet’s penalty save against Chelsea. José Mourinho has complained that, in contrast to Klopp, he was told to sit down or be sent to the stands for his behaviour during Manchester United’s draw with Hull City on Wednesday, while Arsène Wenger recently received a four‑match touchline ban for pushing Anthony Taylor. At a time when referees at grassroots level are planning a nationwide strike in response to the abuse they receive and the Football Association is preparing to relaunch its Respect campaign, Klopp said he and other high-profile managers have a responsibility towards match officials and deserve censure when they step out of line. However, he insisted the pressure and emotion of their jobs should be taken into consideration when passing judgment. “I agree 100%,” Klopp said when asked whether he had a duty to treat referees with respect. “The problem is only that to know about it doesn’t change the moment, that is why we accept the fines. To say we will never do anything like that last game – in this mood I can say 100% I won’t do it but it would be a lie to give a guarantee that it would never happen again. “That’s why there are fines for it. If a reaction is too much then give us a fine. A fine hurts and that’s good. That is a special situation and the situation in a professional football league is different to that in an amateur league. The pressure is completely different. If someone from a fifth, sixth or seventh league thinks that because a manager in the Premier League does this, I can do that, that is wrong. It is a completely different situation. They have another job to do, it is more for fun – all that stuff. “It is not that we have the character to want to have a go at the referee. Do you think Arsène Wenger is the kind of person who, when he sees the fourth official, thinks: ‘I’m going to punch him’ or whatever? That is not how he is and everybody knows it – it happens because of the circumstances and not the personality. Circumstances are pretty special and we all have a kind of pressure. “We all know football is not the most important thing but try telling us that in this moment. In the moment it is unfortunately not true. There is no excuse and that is why there are fines for if you do too much or you are sent to the stands, or banned for three games. I don’t like it if it happens but I have to accept it. It is my fault but that is not to say I can stop it.” Klopp claimed his outburst against Chelsea was the culmination of a series of poor decisions against Liverpool during a run of form that has left his team 10 points behind the Premier League leaders, out of the FA Cup and the EFL Cup in quick succession. He said: “I really try to be nice but in moments where you feel it is not fair – I see the penalty and I thought: ‘Yes, he can whistle it, there was contact’ – but four days earlier [against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup] we had a situation that was much clearer and nobody whistled or spoke about it. You cannot change it but you cannot accept everything like it never happened. “Behind a manager is still a human being and we are all weak in parts. A few of these weaknesses lead to difficult situations and it is not because we are disrespectful. We know how difficult it is. Five times offside against you, by a small margin, and you think: ‘Didn’t we agree that if it was this close you would favour the attacking side?’ Things go more often for you. We conceded a lot of goals which were disallowed. Other teams scored a lot of goals which should have been disallowed. If you put them together they did the same job but the results are different. “Sometimes you feel it in a moment and you look like you look and you say the things you say. Nobody can beat us? I never heard a more silly sentence after three defeats. And I looked at how I looked. I was really lucky in the way the fourth official reacted and I hope he didn’t get in trouble because of how he reacted. That was a reaction from a human being and as a result I could finish the game on the touchline. “After the game I had forgotten about it but then I was told the press will ask about me shouting to the fourth official. And then I saw the pictures, I saw my face and I thought: ‘Oh, fucking hell’. I said what he said and that is how it was. I was lucky, of course.”***********************************************************************Usain Bolt is closer to achieving his lifelong ambition of becoming a professional footballer after agreeing to train with Borussia Dortmund. The nine-time Olympic gold medallist has made no secret of his desire to swap spikes for studs ever since establishing himself as history’s greatest-ever sprinter. Now, in an interview with The Guardian, Bolt has claimed that he and his representatives have “genuinely been talking to people” about the possibility of transitioning to football after retiring from athletics. The interview reveals that Bolt has been in touch with Thomas Tuchel, the Dortmund head coach, who agreed to let him train with the Bundesliga club. The 30-year-old Jamaican wishes to “see what happens” once he has worked with Tuchel, but has his eyes set on a move to Manchester United, the club he supports. Bolt has talked up a move to Old Trafford in the past and was the club’s guest of honour for a Premier League clash with Fulham in 2012 following his success at the London Olympics. “For me, if I could get to play for Manchester United, that would be like a dream come true,” he told The Guardian. “Yes, that would be epic.” Last year, Bolt claimed that he was good enough to at least be offered a trial by United, insisting: “I am fit, I am quick, I can control the ball and I understand all of the play. “I think if I do a trial then they would say, 'You know what, here is a contract for five years! You are 30 years old, here's a five-year contract. Let's just do it!’,” he told MUTV. Bolt welcomed the appointment of Jose Mourinho as United’s manager earlier this year and, once again, claimed he deserved a chance to play under the Portuguese. "I haven't got the call yet, but I know it's coming. I think he's waiting until after the Olympics," Bolt said in July.***********************************************************************More than 1,000 Russian athletes across 30 sports were involved in state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015, it has been revealed. The claims were made in the eagerly anticipated second part of the McLaren Report which was published on Friday morning. Richard McLaren, who coordinated the investigation into allegations of state-sponsored dopings in Russia, concluded that an "institutional conspiracy" had been at work within the country. Speaking after the findings had been made public, McLaren said: “We are now able to confirm the findings of the first report: a cover up that dates back to at least 2011 and continued after the Sochi Winter Olympics games. A cover up that has evolved ... and operated on an unprecedented scale.” “This process [of state-sponsored doping] evolved and was refined at London 2012, the summer University Games at 2013, the Moscow IAAF World Championships in 2013 and of course Sochi 2014.” He added: "We do have evidence backing up what we said." McLaren told reporters his final report provides more detail of just how large the doping conspiracy was, while supplying hard, physical evidence that cannot be contradicted. And in a clear message to those who criticised his interim report, most notably the International Olympic Committee, McLaren said he was dismayed by the "in-fighting" that marked the build-up to Rio Games and has simmered ever since. "I find it difficult to understand why we're not on the same team. We have shone a light on a dark secret," he said. Reading the report, it is difficult to disagree with him. The detail is staggering, even if it is still what McLaren described as "an incomplete picture" given the huge amount of evidence his team has not been able to access. His team has found evidence that 78 Russian athletes at London 2012, including 15 medallists, had positive tests hidden by the Moscow laboratory. Five of these medallists have not been sanctioned yet. It is a similar story for the World Athletics Championships in Moscow, where four athletes had their positive samples swapped for clean ones. And at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, 12 medal-winning athletes are among those implicated.***********************************************************************World pole vault champion Shawn Barber avoided a two-year suspension for an anti-doping violation after inadvertently ingesting cocaine when kissing a woman he met on the internet. The athlete was permitted to compete at the Olympic Games in Rio, despite testing positive for the drug. Barber was spared a ban after successfully arguing that the drug had been passed on through “kissing”. An independent arbitrator ruled “no fault or negligence” by Barber, who finished 10th in Rio. Athletics Canada called the decision “fair and reasonable”. Barber posted an online advert on Craiglist asking for a “sexual encounter of some sort” with a woman who was “drug and disease free”. The athlete admitted that he sought a “way to relieve stress” ahead of the Canadian Olympic trials. The woman involved in the encounter said she had consumed cocaine but did not inform Barber she had taken the drug before going on to repeatedly kiss him. Authorities published the decision, which was made on August 11, on Thursday. Barber said in a statement: "I am obviously satisfied with the result of the hearing where I was found to have zero fault. "I am happy to have this behind me so that I can move on with my career with a free conscience. "At no time during my actions, did I even fathom the possibility of being able to be contaminated with cocaine. This is a learning experience that I hope other athletes can learn from as I have." Barber's lawyer, Paul Greene, added: "Forensic toxicologists have looked at the case and understood... that it was impossible to have taken this amount of cocaine intentionally. "You have inadvertent ingestion of cocaine that is passed to an athlete by way of kissing, which is exactly what happened." Although Barber’s name has been cleared, he will have to forfeit his Canadian title and Championship record which he set on July 9 during the nation’s Olympic trials. Athletics Canada remarked: "We are thankful that the proper procedures recognised the presence of a prohibited substance, but also in ensuring due process to the athlete in coming to a fair and reasonable decision.”***********************************************************************Usain Bolt insists he is fit and ready to race ahead of his first 200 metres of the season at the Muller Anniversary Games on Friday night. The six-time Olympic champion faces a key test of his fitness when he races for the first time since pulling out of the Jamaican trials with a hamstring strain. "I'm good, I'm feeling good, been training good now, I'm happy with where I am," the 29-year-old told a packed press conference. "My hamstring is good, I have no issue right now. I know I'm in good shape." Bolt's outing at the Olympic Stadium, the scene of his three Olympic gold medal wins at London 2012 in the 100m, 200m and sprint relay, will be his last before the Rio Games, where he will bid for an unprecedented 'triple triple' of Olympic crowns. "I'll definitely be there, I'm excited to go," the Jamaican said of his Rio hopes. "This is where history is going to be made, I'm excited to put on a show for the entire world to see. "This is my final Olympics, it's a big one." Bolt is familiar at dealing with, and defying, doubters, especially last year when he went into the World Championships in Beijing trailing two-time convicted drug cheat Justin Gatlin in the 100m and 200m world rankings only to leave China with the complete set of gold medals. "I'm definitely a tough competitor," he said. "Last year Gatlin was just not ready, it was the first time he was being chased. "It was hard for him, but this year is not going to be the same, I am in much better shape, so I won't leave it to the last second." Bolt insisted he was never worried his hamstring problem would rule him out of Rio. "When I got to the doctor he said if I had competed (in the trials) I would probably would have torn my hamstring really badly," he said. "I made the right decision. My coach always makes sure I put my health first. But I was never really worried because my coach always figures out a way to adjust the programme. "I was in pretty good shape before I had to pull out, so I wasn't really worried." It is now seven years since Bolt clocked his 100m and 200m world records of 9.58 and 19.19 seconds respectively and, with his intention to retire after the 2017 World Championships in London, the chances of him breaking them appear slim. Bolt, though, says he is focused on lowering his time in the 200m, an event he has always described as his favourite. "I'm happy that I didn't get a really bad setback this season, it was up and down, but I could always train," he added. "I think the competition, the energy, the work they have to put in to win the 100m in Rio will help my 200m and that's really my focus, trying to break the 200m world record."***********************************************************************Facebook's head of sports has refused to rule out a bid for Premier League broadcast rights as speculation mounts that the online giant is set to enter the English football market. The English top flight's next three-year set of domestic and international broadcast deals are due to be auctioned next year. Some experts believe it is only a matter of time before Facebook, Amazon and other deep-pocketed digital businesses decide to take on the likes of BT and Sky Sports. When asked in London if Facebook would bid, Dan Reed said: "The Premier League is a very important partner of ours and we work with them very closely. "But it would be premature to speculate how we might approach that opportunity - it's still very early days and there is no template for this." Asked if this meant he was not ruling out a bid, Reed said: "That speaks for itself." Launched in 2004, Facebook has become the world's most popular social media platform and earned more than £20billion last year, mostly from online advertising. Facebook says it has two billion users a month and that at least 650 million of those are sports fans, with another 200 million on its picture-sharing platform Instagram. As the world's largest free-to-air platform, the company's huge reach and wealth have already started to make their mark on the sports industry in terms of broadcast partnerships and marketing deals. The California-based firm already has broadcast deals with Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the World Surf League and recently made an unsuccessful £450million bid to broadcast cricket's Indian Premier League. In the first six months of this year, Facebook broadcast more than 3,500 different sports events live, ranging from a partnership with Fox Sports for Champions League games in the United States, to Mexican league football games and college lacrosse. In April, a global audience of five million watched a Barcelona-Real Madrid legends match, while 'Hala Madrid', a behind-the-scenes look at Real shot on GoPro cameras, has become an online hit. But, most intriguingly, Facebook has also just launched a new platform for video content in the US called 'Watch', which Reed said is ideal for sport as it combines "episodic, longer-form viewing" with the conversation and engagement that is the cornerstone of Facebook's appeal. There is also no disputing how important Facebook has become to the industry, with several clubs and leagues using the platform to drive sales of merchandise and tickets, and a number of broadcasters also using targeted adverts to remind users to tune into live sport on television. These relationships are only going to grow and Reed also explained how Facebook was talking to the International Olympic Committee, and almost every global sports federation, about the opportunities the platform offers sports that currently struggle to get on television. That is not to mention the sports rights traditional broadcasters simply waste by not having an outlet through which to show them. All this said, however, there are several obvious obstacles to Facebook, Amazon or anybody else in the digital space making a serious play for live football rights, which is why many seasoned observers of the rights market believe a major shake-up is unlikely next year. So far, neither Facebook nor Amazon has bid for any content as expensive as Premier League rights and there are doubts about how they would make their money back, particularly Facebook and its open platform/online advertising model. Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward recently said clubs were expecting the digital giants to enter the fray next year, a view supported by the chief executive of the world's largest advertising company WPP at the Leaders in Sport conference in London on Wednesday. But WPP's Martin Sorrell tempered the excitement slightly by saying he still believed the rights would end up with BT and Sky Sports, as live football is so important to their business plans.***********************************************************************Is it the structure of the qualifying schedule that is holding international football back? Is it the formula that decides the rankings, and who gets seeded and who does not? Is it having eight groups of four, with the four best third-placers going through?Or is it the fact that international football has been swallowed whole by the club game over the last 20 years? No organisational detail can matter nearly as much as this simple question of status, money and power. International football used to be the peak of the sport, built on top of the platform of club football and recognised, like Test cricket, as its ultimate form. The best international teams – Hungary, Brazil, Holland – took the game on to new levels and the World Cup was its peak. Plenty of people are looking forward to the World Cup next year, but no-one would claim that new standards of play are going to be set in Russia. Even the last two world champions, Germany 2014 and Spain 2010, have just been slower, duller, less interesting  versions of superior club sides who provided their template, in Bayern Munich and Barcelona. But then, when Barcelona and Bayern are the only thing that people want to watch, of course international sides will follow their lead. The story of the last 20 years of football has been the swelling wealth of the biggest club sides, making them richer, stronger and more visible than anyone else in sport. The biggest draws in football are the Champions League and the big European leagues, at least when the big teams play each other. That is why the Premier League raked in £5.1bn for their domestic TV deal from 2016 to 2019. Or why Qatar see Paris Saint-Germain as such a good publicity vehicle that they spent £200m on Neymar this summer with another £145m on Kylian Mbappe to come. Or why Real Madrid have 106 million fans on Facebook, ahead of Barcelona with 103 million. Almost nothing else in the world comes close to this. High-end European club football is one of the biggest entertainment platforms there is, more popular than NBA, the NFL and Hollywood. As attention, money and clout flood towards it, the big clubs just swell further and further. Soon enough they will have their European super league too. How can you expect international football to compete with this hegemonic power? The super-clubs have eaten everything in sight: the lower leagues, the domestic cups, and now the mid-table clubs too. England’s Big Six are trying to go the same way as Real Madrid and Barcelona, pocketing as much of the growing TV revenue as possible, never mind the lower orders. And in the context of this rapacious approach, international football looks rather quaint. Meeting every few months, retreating away from our attentions afterwards, with very little money to throw around or noise to make. How can Brazil or Spain or get heard through everything when they don’t even play a match between November and March? No wonder players, managers and fans are all more interested in the club game. That is why the standard is so low, why the managers would all rather work in club football now instead. When Antonio Conte stormed out of Juventus in 2014 and took over the worst Italy squad in a generation, he nearly won them Euro 2016, in part because he was head and shoulders above all his rival coaches. England and Spain, two of the biggest teams in Europe, now find themselves managed by relative novices. So how do we fix this? How do you redress the balance between predator and prey? The only solution is to hobble the predator. For as long as club football can trample over the international game it will continue to do so. Its instincts cannot be changed, only its capacity can. So Fifa must find a way to handicap the elite. Salary caps, spending caps, taxes on transfer fees, aggressive redistribution of broadcasting money. Only through punitive measures can the big clubs be reined in. Only then is there any chance of the super-club arms race slowing down, creating the space for international football to breathe again. Until that point, until Fifa decide to stand up against power, money and the big-club cartel, and slay the whale, international football will stay irrelevant.***********************************************************************The future direction of the Premier League remains uncertain as a crucial meeting between the division’s clubs ended without resolution. Representatives of the 20 Premier League clubs gathered at a hotel in London’s Mayfair on Wednesday to discuss changing the way in which overseas television income is distributed, covering £1bn of annual revenue and a power struggle between the league’s so-called big six and the rest. In a statement the Premier League confirmed the meeting had ended without agreement. “Premier League clubs today met and discussed the future development of the League. Clubs unanimously agreed to adjourn the meeting to allow further discussion.” The current arrangement, in place since the Premier League came into existence 25 years ago, distributes overseas television revenue equally between all clubs. A new proposal, submitted by the executive chairman, Richard Scudamore, would see 35% of the money distributed according to league position. It is understood that this proposal was not put to a vote before the adjournment. According to the Arsenal chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, the meeting was conducted in a “cordial” atmosphere, but there is an increasing division between Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur and the rest. Those six clubs believe their names persuade broadcasters across the world to buy rights to the Premier League. The rest, particularly those clubs relatively new to the division, point to the competitive nature of the league as being its real selling point. These positions are not easily retractable and both sides can claim to have some form of leverage in negotiations. For the six it is the threat of a possible breakaway, leaving the Premier League to form a European Super League (a threat that also dates back at least 25 years). For the rest of the league they can bargain safe in the knowledge that any adjustment to the rules would require a two-thirds majority vote. Both sides are, however, in agreement about the increasing importance of overseas broadcast revenue to balance sheets. The meeting had been mooted to be the last before negotiations begin on a new round of domestic TV rights, with Sky and BT once again expected to spend billions. But growth is expected to be lower than the 70% achieved for the last contract, while overseas rights continue to rise sharply. sA compromise on foreign income still looks likely, and another meeting of the clubs is expected in the next month.***********************************************************************Rewind one year and British tennis was bathing in the afterglow of a golden summer of success. With a second Wimbledon title and Olympic gold medal to his name, Andy Murray's unabated march to world No 1 was in full swing. The Briton's eventual coronation came in November, beating rival Novak Djokovic to confirm his status as the sport's best male player. Meanwhile, Johanna Konta was busy making a name for herself after years spent flying under the radar. After her breakthrough at the Australian Open, where she reached the first Grand Slam semi-final of her career, Konta would end the summer as the first British woman since Jo Durie to enter the world top 10. She eventually brought her season to a close as the WTA's Most Improved Player of the Year. Gordon Reid, Jamie Murray, and Heather Watson all similarly enjoyed notable success in their respective careers – the latter being crowned Mixed Doubles champion at Wimbledon alongside Henri Kontinen – while Dan Evans and Kyle Edmunds made promising steps forward.But the present paints a rather different picture. After the heady heights of 2016, British tennis finds itself looking forward to an uncertain future – one that offers no real indicator of where the next champion will come from.  In light of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal’s recent resurgence, and their refusal to follow Father Time into retirement, questions remain over what exactly lies in store for Murray as he continues to recover from a persistent hip injury. A notoriously resilient individual, the 30-year-old’s propensity for fighting to the bitter end will no doubt see him bounce back from his recent setback. But as a player who has relied on physicality and power throughout his career, rather than transcendent skill, age is unlikely to treat him well in the same way it has Federer.The real issue is not one of injuries or form, though, but succession. With Murray approaching the back end of his career, no contender to his British throne has yet to emerge. At 47 in the rankings, Edmund, Britain’s current No 2, has shown few real signs of preparing himself for life post-Murray. The 22-year-old has age on his side but has not come close to replicating the success of the Scot who, at the same age, had already reached a Grand Slam final and picked up two Masters titles along the way. In Evans, any hope of British success seems slim at best. Repeated off-court transgressions have tarnished the career of a 27-year-old who once flashed with genuine promise and his recent one-year ban points to a player that, like the proverbial leopard, looks unlikely to change his spots. For now, it seems, Konta carries the burden of British expectation on her shoulders.  Her recent form leaves plenty to be desired – she has won just two matches in her subsequent five tournaments since Wimbledon – but the 26-year-old is undoubtedly Britain’s best female player for decades. Having worked her way up the rankings to world No 7, Konta is rubbing shoulders with the sport’s elite and her impressive run at SW19, where she reached the semi-finals, bears testament to what she is capable of. But while she continues to lead the charge in the women’s field, her British compatriots have struggled to find their feet. Watson’s Mixed Doubles success at Wimbledon in 2016 suggests a career away from singles competition might be better suited to her, while injury and bad luck have hampered the promise Laura Robson showed in her earlier days. The pair seem caught on repeat, struggling in vain to break through into the upper echelons of the sport, consigned instead to the fringes of the women’s tour. It’s not all doom and gloom, though, with a number of British young guns already catching the eye. Jay Clarke, 19, currently stands as the best of the next men’s generation coming through. After that, Jack Draper, 15, is reckoned to be the most promising of Britain’s young boys. Katie Swan, 18, and Gabriella Taylor, 19, are among the best of Britain’s young female players. Of course, what the future holds for these youngster remains to be seen. With an absence of British players among the sport’s NextGen, it seems the summer of 2016 looks set to be consigned to the history books, unlikely to be revisited for years to come. Life after Murray makes for even more bleak reading, and Britain can only hope that Konta steps up to the mark as the ‘people’s champion’ once the Scot hangs up his racket. If not, British tennis faces the difficulty of filling a sizeable void.***********************************************************************England's latest star has had to pay to play for his country after almost being grounded by a missed flight. Jack Harrison was late for his original trip from America on Sunday but forked out £1,200 from his own pocket to book himself on the next plane to London. New York City forward Harrison then had to come up from Heathrow to St George's Park near Burton to link up with the Young Lions ahead of their Euro 2019 qualifiers against Scotland on Friday and Andorra next Tuesday, eventually arriving late on Monday. It was his first call-up after he replaced Sheyi Ojo but Harrison, who had played in New York City's 1-1 draw at Chicago Fire on Saturday, admitted his plans were initially up in the air. He said: "We flew back from Chicago and landed at Westchester Airport. I then had to go home and pack a few things before heading to JFK to catch my flight to London. But the traffic was terrible and I ended up missing my flight. I was really disappointed. I thought the best thing was to get over there. "I tried to contact someone at the FA but it was in the middle of the night over here, so I decided to book the first flight out on Monday morning. "It was 1500 to fly to Heathrow. I hired a car service but they (The FA) changed it because they felt the one they used would be more trustworthy. "I knew there were going to be flights. I checked online and knew there were a couple going into London the next day. I missed the flight on Sunday night. I left New York at 8am on Monday and arrived at St George's at 10:30pm on Monday night. I'm still trying to figure the time difference out." Stoke-born Harrison, 20, was on Manchester United's books as a youngster - playing with Marcus Rashford - before moving to America in 2011 after mum Debbie suggested he should also look after his education. He studied at Berkshire School in Sheffield, Massachusetts, and joined New York City last year having played for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons while at the University. "It was a tough one and when my mum first introduced the idea I was really apprehensive. I didn't want to leave because everyone in that system is just tunnel-visioned and just think about making it to the first team. A lot of players don't," Harrison said. "I was lucky enough to have my mum behind me."  England's latest star has had to pay to play for his country after almost being grounded by a missed flight.

Harrison has 13 goals in 50 games and earned the nickname Golden Boy by some of the world's best players. He added: "It started last year when I recovered from injury and came back with a few goals and some assists. Everyone started calling me 'Golden Boy' and David Villa put it out on Twitter. It's not a bad one at all."***********************************************************************Fc Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has admitted the club would have to discuss the possibility of leaving La Liga if Catalonia gained independence from Spain. There was violence in Catalonia over the weekend after police and voters clashed during the referendum, which has been deemed illegal by the central government, leading Barcelona to take the decision to play their game with Las Palmas on Sunday night behind closed doors. Catalan’s sports minister had already said that teams like Barcelona and Espanyol would be eligible to play in England, France and Italy, as well as Spain, and used teams like Monaco and Swansea of examples of Uefa allowing it. And Bartomeu corroborated this by admitting it would need to be talked about should the region achieve independence. “This situation does not exist so far,” he said on Monday. “But with regards to things that can happen in the future, it is something that the board of directors would discuss. It would be something to analyse calmly. “If we discuss the subject intensely then obviously we will find the best solution. But if this [independence] happens, the board of directors will see.”***********************************************************************Alexandre Lacazette has admitted he’s been doing his homework in a bid to adapt to English football – and the “dangerous” decision-making of match officials. The Frenchman joined Arsenal in the summer for a club record £52.7m after nine years at Lyon. A clinical and prolific goalscorer in Ligue 1, questions were raised over whether the 26-year-old would be able to adjust to the physicality of the Premier League. Lacazette has certainly made a positive start, scoring four goals from seven games for Arsenal, but the player believes he still has much to learn. “I have not totally adapted yet, there are things that still surprise me, but I am trying,” the 26-year-old Frenchman told SFR Sport. “I've watched quite a few matches to understand English football. “I watch quite a lot of my matches with Arsenal and when I look back and see what I didn’t do right, I try to learn from it, which hopefully facilitates my progression.” Lacazette also admitted that he has been taken aback by the nature of refereeing in English matches. “The refereeing decisions [still surprise me],” he said. “Sometimes I think it is a bit dangerous. “But then I see that nobody is shocked, so I tell myself it must be normal.” When it comes to learning the tricks of the English trade, Lacazette said he turns to Thierry Henry – an Arsenal icon and personal hero of his. "Henry was my idol, we talk a lot. He gives me advice, and if I have some questions I know I can count on him."***********************************************************************Lewis Hamilton has said there will be no let-up in his drive to claim a fourth Formula One world championship as the season enters the final five meetings at the Japanese Grand Prix this weekend. The British driver was insistent that his battle with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel would remain fiercely competitive and that he would “prepare for war”. Hamilton leads Vettel by 34 points after he claimed second place at the last round in Malaysia while Vettel, who had started at the back of the grid, could manage only fourth. Hamilton, who had struggled with his car in Sepang with the Mercedes proving difficult to set up and lacking the pace of both the Red Bulls and Ferraris, was under no illusions of what he had to do to maintain the advantage. “I’ve got to make sure I’m fit, healthy, focused,” the British driver said. “Basically prepare for war. That’s what I try and do, make sure every weekend I’m the best prepared I can be.” Hamilton had trailed Vettel in the title race until Monza but he has now won four of the past five races and seven this season. Vettel has four victories but the Ferrari was quicker at the past two rounds and displayed a marked improvement in pace after an engine upgrade in Malaysia. He dropped points after going out in a first-lap crash in Singapore and the grid penalty at Sepang. If Hamilton leaves Japan with a 28-point gap over Vettel he can afford to finish second at the remaining races and still take the title. But he and his team, who are still having to work at how best to manage their car at different circuits and under differing conditions, were aware they could take nothing for granted. “The goal is to continue to win races even if I don’t have to,” he said. “I’m still hunting it, I’m not defending it, I’m still hunting, I’m still chasing. Until that last flag, until I’ve actually got it, you’ve got to keep pushing as hard as you can. I don’t foresee any of the coming races being easy, we need to stay on our toes as it can still be lost.” Certainly he will be confident in his own ability to master the unforgiving test of Suzuka. The track rewards precision and commitment, both of which characterise Hamilton’s style, if he is comfortable he has the car he requires, although that is not reflected in his record at Suzuka – where he has won only twice before, in 2014 and 2015. One of the finest moments of his career was at the Japanese Grand Prix when it was held at Fuji Speedway in 2007. He won there in terrible conditions and has described it as one of his five best races. Unsurprisingly, his performance won him a lot of Japanese supporters. Hamilton is certainly not lacking support here. The home fans were out in force – with several thousand in the main grandstand alone, on a day when no cars are on track. Alongside the usual array of detailed home-made headwear – including rear wings, with working DRS lovingly attached to some crash hats – was a swathe of union flags emblazoned with messages of support for Hamilton and he expressed gratitude for the encouragement. However, the Englishman’s focus remained firmly on claiming the title by earning it. “I don’t want to rely on fortune from the others’ misfortune,” Hamilton said. “Ultimately if it’s on personal performance from Sebastian, I’m not bothered about that.” The key factor that could remain decisive in the championship was whether Mercedes could master the demanding requirements of their car for the remaining rounds. “I’m confident in the car, confident in it working at some stages,” he said. “Just still this deep into the season I have no idea where it’s gonna be good, where it’s gonna be great like Silverstone or where it’ll be a real struggle like Malaysia or Singapore. “That’s the exciting thing. If we were going into the race beyond this and knew what was going to happen it would be kind of dull. I like that I’m arriving and I don’t know.”***********************************************************************A return to “normality” in Formula One next season – “to be on the podium and fight for victories” – is Fernando Alonso’s expectation for McLaren after the team formally announced their partnership with Honda would end this year. The relationship has proved to be a very public car crash for the team and the engine manufacturer over the last three years and Alonso has been absolutely clear that he held Honda responsible. His optimism stems from the switch to Renault power units but the task that lies ahead for McLaren remains immense. The most successful British racing team, with eight constructors’ and 12 driver’s titles, have not won a race since Jenson Button’s victory at Brazil in 2012. They have not claimed a constructors’ title since 1998. The switch to Renault is not going to reverse this trend overnight but it may be enough to lay the foundations for the future. The partnership with Honda, engineered by Ron Dennis, had at its heart the belief that the team could not challenge for the title with a customer engine and needed a works partnership. A sound theory, but in recent years Toyota, BMW and Honda themselves have discovered that being a works outfit guarantees nothing in F1. McLaren’s hopes for a return to the glory days of their partnership in the late 1980s and early 90s turned to bitter ashes. Their engine has been underpowered and unreliable throughout. On Wednesday the team’s racing director, Éric Boullier, was blunt about the failed partnership. “When you look at the last three years it’s been a proper disaster for us in terms of credibility and getting new sponsors,” he said. Boullier, however, shared Alonso’s optimism. “You have to take the long-term view,” he added. “In the next five years I am absolutely sure that we will go back to where McLaren belongs. And with this bouncing back we get our credibility back and it will rebuild our sponsor portfolio. It might take two to three years.” He, at least, has put a reasonable timescale on it, as opposed to Honda, who said in Singapore they expected their new partnership with Toro Rosso would put them into the top three, a singularly spectacular failure in managing expectations. McLaren’s executive director, Zak Brown, who took over at the end of last year, told me early in the season he should be judged by the team’s results. By ditching Honda he has made the first step to improving them but the difficult job lies ahead. The team will take a huge hit commercially from dropping Honda – understood to be around $100m (£74m) a year, a blow exacerbated by a lack of sponsors and poor finishes resulting in a drop in prize money. But nonetheless financially they do not have to worry in the short-term. Brown has been explicit that the team’s Bahraini owners are unafraid of backing them and have the financial muscle to do so. Equally at the factory in Woking they have the resources, numbers and experience to put that backing to good use. This would, it is hoped, kickstart the cycle of recovery. Better results mean more prize money and more sponsors. “We are ninth in the championship,” said Boullier. “With a top engine I think we would be fourth right now and just on the FOM [prize] money we could cover the engine side, so it will not be a big risk on the monetary side. Thanks to the shareholders who have been brave enough to take a sporting choice and not hurt McLaren.” The Renault engine is the third best on the grid this season – they are bringing a new concept to the 2018 iteration but it will have to go some to challenge Mercedes and Ferrari. The power unit switch alone will not put McLaren on the front of the grid. In their favour, however, their chassis does appear strong and with some decent horses they can at least target challenging Red Bull, subject to having to alter their car to the architecture of the Renault engine. All of which does promise improvement; even if the race wins Alonso desires may be some way off, Boullier’s five-year prediction is instructive. The switch to Renault was desperately needed by the team but it is not necessarily the solution. Brown has spoken about looking forward to the new engine regulations of 2021, for which Porsche, Aston Martin, Cosworth and indeed McLaren themselves are considering manufacturing power units. Rebuilding for now and coming back to the top when the playing field has been levelled with a less engine-dependent formula, is an entirely realistic proposition and one to be welcomed. F1 needs a strong McLaren, at the heart of which is Alonso, who will visit the factory this week where it is expected he will finalise a new deal with the team. Alonso is the final key to McLaren’s rejuvenation. The double world champion is one of the few drivers able to extract more from his machinery than it promises on paper – he can bring the forward momentum they so badly need. With the driver market opening up at the end of 2018, Alonso may want only a one-year contract but McLaren need to show him they are a proposition worth sticking with. Now they have a proven engine there is nowhere to hide. If they are to return to the top, next season must prove to be the start of a new era for the team.
