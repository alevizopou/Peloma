COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN <Person gate:gateId="1095" rule="PersonFullInitials" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" initials="W." surname="EUROPE" kind="fullName">W. EUROPE</Person>
  Cold and wet weather in northern,
  western and central parts of <Location gate:gateId="1096" locType="region" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Europe</Location> continued to slow beet
  growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
  countries, sugar statistician <Person gate:gateId="1097" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="unknown" surname="Licht" kind="personName" rule="PersonTitleGenderUnknown" title="F.O." gate:matches="1053;1080;1081">F.O. Licht</Person> said.
      Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
  hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
  fields.
      But in eastern and <Location gate:gateId="1098" locType="pre" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">southeastern Europe</Location>, warmer weather has
  boosted sugar beet growth.
      Weather in the <Organization gate:gateId="1099" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1055;1064">Soviet Union</Organization> also allowed good beet
  development, <Person gate:gateId="1093" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="1053;1080;1081">Licht</Person> said.
      In <Location gate:gateId="1082" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Sweden</Location> beet growth has been delayed, although plant
  population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
  weather slowed beet growth in <Location gate:gateId="1083" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" kind="locName">Denmark</Location> and crop prospects are
  rated as slightly below normal.
      In the <Location gate:gateId="1084" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">United Kingdom</Location> and Ireland, it was rather cool with
  heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
      In <Location gate:gateId="1085" locType="country" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">France</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1086" locType="country" rule="GazLocation" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Belgium</Location>, <Location gate:gateId="1087" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">the Netherlands</Location>, and <Location gate:gateId="1088" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">West Germany</Location>, it
  was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
  continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
  impossible.
      In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
  favourable for beet growth, <Person gate:gateId="1094" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="1053;1080;1081">Licht</Person> said.
      In <Location gate:gateId="1089" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Czechoslovakia</Location> and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
  beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
      In the European beet growing regions of the <Organization gate:gateId="1090" orgType="unknown" rule="TheOrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal" gate:matches="1055;1064">Soviet Union</Organization>,
  it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
  generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
      In south <Location gate:gateId="1091" locType="pre" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">eastern Europe</Location>, warm weather with some rainfall
  boosted beet development.
      Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in <Location gate:gateId="1092" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" kind="locName">Spain</Location>. Disputes
  between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
  delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
  beets are maturing very early this year.
