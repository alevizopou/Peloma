  <Location gate:gateId="2456" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location> will not increase sugar imports
  substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
  and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
  domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
      &quot;Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
  last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
  be extremely serious,&quot; the <Person gate:gateId="2452" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="2422;2424">Farmers Daily</Person> said. It said 1986
  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
      The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
  (November/<Location gate:gateId="2458" locType="city" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">March</Location>) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
      The <Location gate:gateId="2426" locType="province" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Yunnan</Location> 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
  tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
  figure. Output in <Location gate:gateId="2427" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="province" kind="locName">Guangxi</Location> was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New <Location gate:gateId="2428" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location>
  <Organization gate:gateId="2429" orgType="unknown" rule="OrgXBase" ruleFinal="OrgFinal">News Agency</Organization> said without giving a year-earlier figure.
      The <Person gate:gateId="2453" rule="PersonSays">Nanfang Daily</Person> said production in <Location gate:gateId="2430" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="province" gate:matches="2373;2374;2378" kind="locName">Guangdong</Location> province
  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
  area under sugar was dropping.
      &quot;Supply of cane (in <Location gate:gateId="2431" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="province" gate:matches="2373;2374;2378" kind="locName">Guangdong</Location>) is inadequate,&quot; the newspaper
  said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
  nearly all the <Person gate:gateId="2432" rule="GazPersonFirst" firstName="mills" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="2375;2381;2385;2386" kind="firstName">mills</Person> is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
  is a major problem.&quot;
      A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n <Location gate:gateId="2433" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="province" gate:matches="2376;2379">Fujian</Location>,
  <Location gate:gateId="2434" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2377;2398">south China</Location>&apos;s fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
  area planted.
      He said the rural sectors in <Location gate:gateId="2435" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="province" gate:matches="2373;2374;2378" kind="locName">Guangdong</Location> and <Location gate:gateId="2436" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="province" gate:matches="2376;2379">Fujian</Location> were wel
  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
      The <Person gate:gateId="2455" rule="PersonSays" gate:matches="2422;2424">Farmers Daily</Person> said a peasant in the ortheast province
  of <Location gate:gateId="2437" locType="province" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Heilongjiang</Location> could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
      The paper said the profit margin of <Person gate:gateId="2438" rule="FirstPersonStop" ruleFinal="PersonFinal" gender="male" gate:matches="2375;2381;2385;2386" kind="firstName">mills</Person> in <Location gate:gateId="2439" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location> fell to
  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.

      The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
  official press has said.
      Customs figures showed <Location gate:gateId="2442" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location> imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
      The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
      A foreign trader here said <Location gate:gateId="2443" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location> accumulated large stocks
  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
  sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
  when the central government resumed control of imports.
      &quot;As <Location gate:gateId="2444" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location> lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
  in <Location gate:gateId="2445" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="province" kind="locName">Qinghai</Location>, Inner <Location gate:gateId="2446" locType="country" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal">Mongolia</Location> and other inland areas,&quot; the diplomat
  said.
      The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
  consumers in east and <Location gate:gateId="2447" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="pre" gate:matches="2377;2398">south China</Location> was a problem, particularly
  as coal had priority. &quot;How quickly they can move the sugar is
  one factor determining import levels,&quot; he said.
      Another factor was the quality of the harvest in <Location gate:gateId="2448" rule="InLoc1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" kind="locName">Cuba</Location>,
  <Location gate:gateId="2449" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location>&apos;s major supplier through barter trade, he said.
      &quot;<Location gate:gateId="2450" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location> bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
  152/153 dlrs a tonne,&quot; he added. &quot;<Location gate:gateId="2451" rule="Location1" ruleFinal="LocFinal" locType="country" gate:matches="2359;2360;2371;2382;2388;2392;2395;2400;2401;2403">China</Location> is not a desperate buyer
  now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
  the open market.&quot;
      A Japanese trader said <Person gate:gateId="2457" rule="SaysPerson">Peking</Person>&apos;s major concern regarding
  imports was price.
      &quot;While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
  foreign exchange restraints persist,&quot; he said.
      The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
  pct a year but &quot;a communist government is in a much better
  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
  foreign exchange situation demands it.&quot;
